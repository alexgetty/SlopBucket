# Study Finds Two-Factor Authentication Users 40% More Likely To Apologize For Things That Weren't Their Fault

A new study from researchers at an unspecified European institution has found a striking correlation between two-factor authentication usage and reflexive apologizing, even when no wrongdoing has occurred.

"We're sorry if these findings make anyone uncomfortable," said the study's lead author, who asked not to be named. "That's not what we intended."

The research, which everyone in Silicon Valley has apparently known about for years, analyzed the behavior of 2,400 participants who regularly verify their identities through authenticator apps, SMS codes, and increasingly desperate attempts to remember where they wrote down their backup codes.

The results were unambiguous: those who authenticate twice are 40% more likely to say "sorry" when someone else bumps into them, 67% more likely to apologize for asking a question in a meeting, and 89% more likely to begin emails with "Sorry to bother you."

"We've always done security this way," noted [[Dr. Harrison Cho]], a behavioral economist not affiliated with the study. "Our grandparents had passwords. Our parents had passwords. We added a second step, and somehow that's when the apologizing started. The correlation is clear."

Critics have called the findings "low-hanging fruit," suggesting the researchers could have investigated more complex security-psychology relationships. The authors apologized for the oversight but noted that the criticism wasn't entirely fair, then apologized for being defensive.

The study recommends that users who experience excessive apologetic behavior consider switching to biometric authentication, which the data suggests produces a 12% increase in unearned confidence.

"Fingerprint and facial recognition users don't apologize," explained [[Dr. Harrison Cho]]. "They've already surrendered their biological identity to a device. What's left to be sorry about?"

The researchers suggest this phenomenon may extend further. Early data indicates that users who enable location tracking apologize 23% less, those who opt into predictive behavioral analytics apologize 31% less, and those who voluntarily share their data with government contractors don't apologize at all.

"Once you accept that someone, somewhere, knows everything about you at all times, the anxiety lifts," the study concludes. "You're not hiding anything. You can't be caught. You're free."

The study was funded by a grant from Palantir.
