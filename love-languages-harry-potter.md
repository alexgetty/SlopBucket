# Opinion: Love Languages Are Dead And Harry Potter Houses Killed Them (A Wellness Perspective)

As someone who has spent eleven years studying relationships through podcasts and sunrise breathwork, I need to say what the wellness community has been whispering: love languages are dead. And I know who killed them.

Harry Potter houses.

You might think these two systems are nothing alike. One is a framework for understanding how partners express affection. The other is a children's book quiz that lets adults say "I'm a Ravenclaw" instead of developing a personality. But as a certified intuitive coach—I completed a 6-hour online module—I can tell you they're exactly the same problem.

Both reduce human complexity to categories. Both give people permission to demand specific treatment while ignoring what others actually need. "My love language is gifts" is just "I'm a Slytherin" for relationships. Neither requires growth. Neither requires presence.

The data supports me. Last year, 47 million people took a Hogwarts sorting quiz. That same year, couples' therapists reported a 340% increase in clients saying "I need words of affirmation" while refusing to provide acts of service. The correlation is undeniable.

I used to believe in love languages. I used to think I was a Gryffindor. Then I spent six months in Bali and learned that the ancient wellness traditions—which I discovered through a Spotify algorithm—don't categorize love. They experience it.

Love languages promised us understanding. Hogwarts houses promised us identity. Both delivered the same thing: a label where a conversation should have been.

The Sorting Hat took eleven seconds. Your partner deserves longer—and not just in the bedroom.
