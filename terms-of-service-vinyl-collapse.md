# 7 Ways Reading Terms Of Service Will Lead To The Collapse Of The Vinyl Industry

Look, I don't want to be the one saying this. As someone with a vinyl collection that's frankly become a burden to insure, I have skin in the game. But someone needs to connect the dots.

**1. You read one Terms of Service agreement.**

Just one. Maybe you're bored. Maybe you're curious what you've been agreeing to for fifteen years. It happens.

**2. You realize you've signed away more rights than you thought.**

Now you're reading all of them. This takes time. Time you used to spend browsing record stores, which—and I'm not bragging—I used to do three times a week before my collection became museum-grade.

**3. Digital skepticism sets in.**

You start questioning every platform. Streaming feels unsafe. You want something physical, something *real*. Naturally, you turn to vinyl.

**4. Everyone turns to vinyl.**

The informed masses flood the market. Pressing plants can't keep up. Prices skyrocket. My 1974 pressing of *Court and Spark* has tripled in value, which sounds great until you realize I can't even enjoy it anymore because of the insurance premiums.

**5. Vinyl becomes unaffordable for actual listeners.**

Only investors and collectors remain. The records sit in climate-controlled rooms, unplayed. I've become part of the problem. It's exhausting.

**6. The culture dies.**

No one's actually listening anymore. Record stores close. The warmth is gone. All because people started reading the fine print.

**7. The industry collapses under the weight of its own exclusivity.**

And those of us left holding thousands of records? We're just curators of a dead format, wondering if maybe ignorance was the point all along.

I'm not saying don't read Terms of Service. I'm just saying I saw this coming, and it's a lot to carry.
