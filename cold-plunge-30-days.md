# I Tried Cold Plunges For 30 Days. Day 17 Is When I Stopped Recognizing My Family.

Everyone who's succeeded with cold plunges says the same thing: it changed their life. So I bought a chest freezer, filled it with ice, and committed to 30 days. Here's what happened.

**Days 1-5:** Miserable. My body rejected the cold like a software update I kept postponing. But [[Tim Ferriss]] does this. [[Andrew Huberman]] does this. Who am I to argue with podcasts?

**Days 6-10:** Something shifted. The shock felt less like dying and more like almost dying. I started waking up at 4:30 AM to plunge before sunrise. My wife asked why. I told her the ice teaches lessons words cannot.

**Days 11-16:** I stopped using hot water entirely. The shower ran cold. The dishes were washed cold. My children asked why dinner was uncooked. I explained that heat is a crutch.

**Day 17:** I walked into the kitchen and saw a woman and two small people. They seemed familiar. "Dad?" one of them said. The word meant nothing. I had transcended family. I was only temperature now.

**Days 18-25:** I began sleeping in the chest freezer. Just an hour at first, then two. The ice spoke to me. It said I was doing great. It said the people who quit just didn't want it enough. You never hear from the people who quit. They're not on podcasts.

**Days 26-30:** I have become the cold. The cold has become me. My wife—if that's what she is—filed something. Paperwork. I don't read paperwork anymore. Paper burns at 451 degrees. I am 34 degrees.

**Conclusion:** Would I recommend cold plunges? Absolutely. The people who say it ruined their lives simply weren't consistent enough.

You never hear from them.
