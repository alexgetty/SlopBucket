    <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
    <p class="last-updated">Effective Date: The moment you loaded this page (gotcha)</p>

    <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
    <p>By accessing this website, you agree to these terms. By reading this sentence, you've already agreed. By thinking about closing this tab, you've agreed twice. There's no way out of this. You agreed the moment you heard about us from a friend. Your friend also agreed.</p>

    <h2>2. Description of Service</h2>
    <p>Slop Bucket provides content. The nature of this content is content-ish. We make no guarantees that the content will be good, true, useful, or content. It might just be words arranged in an order.</p>

    <h2>3. User Conduct</h2>
    <p>You agree not to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Use this website for any unlawful purpose (lawful purposes only, please)</li>
        <li>Take anything here seriously</li>
        <li>Cite us in academic papers (your professor will be disappointed)</li>
        <li>Read articles aloud at parties (you will not be invited back)</li>
        <li>Believe anything without checking other sources</li>
        <li>Check other sources and then still believe us anyway</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Intellectual Property</h2>
    <p>All content on this website is protected by intellectual property laws that we assume exist. You may not reproduce, distribute, or claim you wrote any of this, even though you probably could have.</p>

    <h2>5. Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
    <p>THIS WEBSITE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" AND "AS WHATEVER THIS IS." WE DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING THE WARRANTY THAT THIS WEBSITE IS A GOOD USE OF YOUR TIME.</p>

    <h2>6. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>Under no circumstances shall Slop Bucket be liable for any damages arising from the use of this website, including but not limited to: wasted time, damaged credibility, lost arguments, confused family members, or the vague sense that you could be doing something more productive.</p>

    <h2>7. Indemnification</h2>
    <p>You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Slop Bucket from any claims arising from your use of this website. If someone sues us because of something you did, that's on you. We don't know why you would do something sue-worthy on a website like this, but here we are, writing this paragraph.</p>

    <h2>8. Governing Law</h2>
    <p>These terms shall be governed by the laws of the internet, which are vibes-based and inconsistently enforced.</p>

    <h2>9. Changes to Terms</h2>
    <p>We reserve the right to modify these terms at any time. Continued use of the website constitutes acceptance of new terms. Discontinued use also constitutes acceptance. Looking at the sky and thinking about clouds constitutes acceptance. It's acceptance all the way down.</p>

    <h2>10. Contact</h2>
    <p>Questions about these terms can be directed to our legal department, which is a Magic 8-Ball that says "Ask again later" with suspicious consistency.</p>
