    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: Whenever you're reading this</p>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>We collect whatever your browser accidentally tells us, which is surprisingly a lot. We didn't ask for it, but here we are.</p>

    <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>Honestly? We don't. We wouldn't know what to do with it. There's a database somewhere with numbers in it. No one has the password anymore. Dave set it up in 2004 and Dave doesn't work here. We don't know where Dave is.</p>

    <h2>Cookies</h2>
    <p>This website uses cookies, probably. We're not entirely sure what they do, but the tutorial said to include them. If you don't like cookies, you can disable them in your browser settings. If you do like cookies, that's nice. We like cookies too. The snickerdoodle ones especially.</p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>We may share your information with third parties, which is a scary thing to read in a privacy policy. In practice, this means the visitor counter might be telling someone you were here. We can't confirm who. It was free software from a website that no longer exists.</p>

    <h2>Data Retention</h2>
    <p>We retain your data for as long as it takes us to forget we have it, which based on current practices is already done.</p>

    <h2>Your Rights</h2>
    <p>You have the right to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Access your data (if you can find it, let us know)</li>
        <li>Delete your data (see above)</li>
        <li>Be forgotten (we've already forgotten you)</li>
        <li>Data portability (you can take whatever this is wherever you want)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>This website is not intended for children under 13, primarily because children under 13 have better things to do.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this privacy policy from time to time. We will not notify you because we don't have your contact information. See "Information We Collect."</p>

    <h2>Contact Us</h2>
    <p>If you have privacy concerns, please direct them to the void. The void is GDPR compliant.</p>
