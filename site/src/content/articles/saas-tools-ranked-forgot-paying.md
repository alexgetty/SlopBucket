I used to believe in software. I'd sign up for every tool that promised to optimize my workflow, automate my life, and finally achieve inbox zero. I was wrong. Here's what I learned, ranked by how many months each tool charged my card before I remembered it existed.

**12. Calendly** — 4 months
I remembered this existed when a stranger booked 6 AM on a Sunday. The tool worked exactly as designed. I had simply designed my own nightmare.

**11. Grammarly Premium** — 7 months
I write for a living. Premium corrected my spelling of "definitely" 847 times. I could have hired a child.

**10. Superhuman** — 9 months
Thirty dollars a month for an email client. My inbox is exactly as overwhelming as before, but now it loads faster, so I experience the dread instantly.

**9. Loom Pro** — 11 months
Recorded four videos. Three were tests to see if I looked okay. One was sent to a client who never opened it. Cost per viewed video: undefined.

**8. Zapier** — 14 months
I built one automation. It broke the same week. I kept paying for fourteen months because canceling would mean admitting I'm not someone who automates things.

**7. Miro** — 16 months
I have never opened Miro by myself. Every memory I have of it is someone else's screen, someone else's sticky notes, someone else's plan. I paid to watch.

**6. Pitch** — 19 months
Used it once to make a presentation titled "Consolidating Our Tool Stack." The irony was not apparent to me at the time.

**5. Webflow** — 23 months
I do not have a website. I have a Webflow account. These are different things.

**4. Airtable** — 26 months
I remember signing up. I remember the excitement. I remember thinking "this changes everything." I do not remember what "everything" was or how it was supposed to change.

**3. Riverside.fm** — 27 months
For a podcast I recorded three episodes of. The podcast was about productivity. I will not be taking questions.

**2. Clockify Pro** — 31 months
A time-tracking tool. I never once tracked my time. If I had, I would have noticed 31 months ago that I was paying for a time-tracking tool.

**1. Monday.com** — 34 months
I have worked alone for six years. Monday.com is team collaboration software. I paid $4,080 to collaborate with myself. I did not collaborate once. I did, however, receive weekly emails asking how my team was doing.

I used to think the problem was finding the right tool. Now I understand: the tool was never the problem. I was the problem. I still am. I cancelled Monday.com last week and signed up for Asana.

**Format: Definitive Ranking**

The numbered list implies methodology. "Ranked by how long I forgot" sounds like a metric, but it's just personal failures presented with the confidence of data-driven analysis.

**Archetype: I Was Wrong Humble Pivot**

The confession of past naivety ("I used to believe in software") positions the author as wiser now. But the final line—signing up for Asana—reveals no growth. The humility is performance.

**Fallacy: Circular Reasoning**

"The tool was never the problem. I was the problem." This sounds profound but explains nothing. The solution to over-subscribing is to subscribe again. The cycle is the point.
