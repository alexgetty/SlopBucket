A new study on vaccine hesitancy has produced an unexpected result: a 23% increase in vaccination rates among the very population it studied.

The study, published this week by researchers at a major university, examined patterns of vaccine refusal in communities with historically low immunization rates. Within 48 hours of publication, those same communities reported a surge in vaccine appointments.

"We did not anticipate this," said [[Dr. Martin Huang]], lead author of the study. "We published data showing these groups were unlikely to vaccinate. They appear to have vaccinated specifically to prove us wrong."

Researchers noted that the effect was strongest among demographics the study explicitly identified as vaccine-hesitant. In one county cited as having the lowest vaccination rate in the region, appointments increased by 340% the day after the study was reported in local news.

"We're calling it 'contrarian compliance,'" Dr. Huang said. "They're not pro-vaccine. They just hate us being right about them."

Health officials expressed cautious optimism about the findings but warned the effect could disrupt future research efforts. "If people vaccinate every time we publish a study saying they won't, we may have accidentally discovered the most effective public health intervention in decades," said [[Dr. Rachel Simmons]], who was not involved in the research. "But we can't say that out loud or it stops working." She paused. "I just said that out loud, didn't I."

Some researchers are concerned about the implications. "First they reject one study to prove a point," said [[Dr. Alan Bright]], a behavioral economist. "Next they're exercising to spite fitness surveys. Then they're saving for retirement just because we said they wouldn't. Where does it end?"

The authors acknowledged limitations in their methodology, noting they had not anticipated their subjects reading the study about them. A follow-up study is planned, though researchers have declined to disclose its focus.

"If we tell them what we're studying, they'll do the opposite," Dr. Huang said. "Which, depending on the topic, could be very good or very bad."

**Format: Study Finds**

The "study finds" format lends scientific authority to any claim. Vague institutional attribution ("researchers at a major university"), precise statistics (23%, 340%), and named researchers create the appearance of rigor. The format makes absurd findings feel credible.

**Archetype: Slippery Slope**

Dr. Bright's warning—"First they reject one study... then they're saving for retirement"—follows the slippery slope formula. A minor behavior (spite-vaccination) is projected to cascade into increasingly absurd positive outcomes, inverting the typical doom-and-gloom slope.

**Fallacy: Contrarian Backfire**

The article satirizes reflexive contrarianism—the impulse to reject anything presented by perceived authorities. The joke is that this impulse can be weaponized: if you know someone will do the opposite of what you say, you control them completely.

**Constraint: Disrupt**

"Disrupt future research efforts" applies Silicon Valley's favorite verb to public health bureaucracy. The word implies innovation; here it describes scientists accidentally stumbling into reverse psychology.
