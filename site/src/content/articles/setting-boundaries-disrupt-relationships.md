Mental health professionals are raising concerns about a troubling trend: people setting boundaries.

A new report from the Institute for Relational Dynamics suggests that boundary-setting, once considered a cornerstone of psychological wellness, may disrupt up to 73% of existing relationships when actually practiced.

"In theory, boundaries are healthy," said Dr. Karen Whitfield, a clinical psychologist who requested her workplace not be named. "In practice, they make Thanksgiving very quiet."

The concern centers on what researchers call "therapy speak leakage"—the migration of clinical vocabulary from professional settings into casual conversation. Terms like "boundaries," "holding space," "toxic," and "I need you to validate my experience" were designed for controlled environments with trained mediators present.

"These phrases were never meant to be deployed at brunch," Dr. Whitfield said.

The report found that 68% of respondents who began setting boundaries experienced immediate pushback from people they described as "not respecting my boundaries." An additional 41% reported that family members characterized their boundaries as "this new thing you learned from TikTok."

Experts note that the issue is particularly acute among adults who recently started therapy. "There's a window—usually months two through eight—where patients become, clinically speaking, insufferable," said Dr. David Okonkwo, a family therapist. "It's like a child who just learned a new word. They will find a way to use it in every conversation until you wish you'd never taught them to speak."

The report recommends that individuals who wish to set boundaries consider the relational investment already made. "You've spent 35 years tolerating your mother-in-law," Dr. Whitfield said. "Is 'protecting your energy' worth disrupting that?"

For those unwilling to abandon boundaries entirely, experts suggest softening the language. Instead of "I'm setting a boundary," try "I'm going to be weird about this and I don't want to explain why." The meaning is identical, but the clinical framing is removed.

Dr. Okonkwo offered an alternative approach. "Have you considered simply avoiding that person forever without ever explaining why? It's just as effective, and no one has to hear the word 'boundary.'"

**Format: Experts Warn**

The "experts warn" format manufactures alarm through unnamed authorities and vague institutional backing. "Institute for Relational Dynamics" sounds credible but conveys no verifiable information. The experts are quoted extensively but say nothing actionable.

**Archetype: Thread Energy**

The article fragments a simple observation—boundaries upset people who benefited from your lack of them—into a series of quote-driven beats that create false complexity. Each paragraph feels like a new revelation. None are.

**Fallacy: Sunk Cost**

"You've spent 35 years tolerating your mother-in-law" is pure sunk cost reasoning. Past suffering is framed as investment that shouldn't be abandoned. The implicit argument: you've already sacrificed your wellbeing, so continue.
