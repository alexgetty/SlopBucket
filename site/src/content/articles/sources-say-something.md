Multiple anonymous sources have confirmed that the thermostat in Building C was adjusted sometime between 2 and 4 PM yesterday.

The sources, who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss climate control policy, say the temperature was changed by "at least two degrees, possibly three." One source described the adjustment as "aggressive." Another called it "a clear escalation."

"People are cold," said one source close to the situation, speaking on background. "People are very cold, and someone did this."

A spokesperson for Facilities Management declined to confirm whether the thermostat had been accessed. "We don't comment on ongoing temperature matters," the spokesperson said. When pressed on whether the building even had a thermostat, the spokesperson ended the call.

The identity of the adjuster remains unknown. Sources say suspicion has fallen on several individuals in the northeast cubicle cluster, though no formal accusations have been made. "We all know who it is," said one source. "We just can't prove it."

Observers note this is the third temperature incident this quarter. Previous adjustments in March and September resulted in passive-aggressive email chains and at least one strongly worded note posted near the break room.

Critics of the adjustment have criticized it, citing personal discomfort. Supporters, who sources say "run hot," have declined to comment publicly but were observed wearing short sleeves.

This story is developing. The thermostat has reportedly been adjusted again.

**Format: Breaking News**

The breathless urgency of crisis journalism—anonymous sources, official spokespeople, developing situations—applied to an office thermostat dispute. The vocabulary of serious reporting creates false stakes around something genuinely petty, exposing how the format itself manufactures importance.

**Archetype: Anonymous Sources**

Everyone requires anonymity to discuss... temperature preferences. The protection framework designed for whistleblowers and sensitive leaks is deployed for people who are slightly chilly. The gap between the machinery and the stakes is the joke.

**Fallacy: Appeal to Authority**

Sources, Facilities Management spokespeople, observers—the article is dense with authority figures treating a thermostat adjustment like a geopolitical incident. We're trained to trust these roles, so the framing feels credible even when the content is absurd.
