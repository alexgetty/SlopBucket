"A wizard is never late, nor is he early." Great philosophy, terrible for sprint planning.

Our experts have conducted an exhaustive analysis of Gandalf the Grey's (later White) management style, and the results are damning. Middle Earth's most powerful consultant would never survive a quarterly review.

Let's start with documentation. The man refuses to share it. "Keep it secret, keep it safe" is not a viable knowledge management strategy. When Gandalf eventually gets hit by a bus (or Balrog), that institutional knowledge goes with him. No handoff notes. No README. Nothing.

Then there's the communication style. Gandalf speaks almost exclusively in riddles and ominous prophecies. "All we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given us" sounds profound until you realize it contains zero actionable items and no clear ownership.

His project scoping is equally problematic. "Destroy the One Ring" is not a user story. Where are the acceptance criteria? What's the definition of done? "Mount Doom" is not a sprint milestone—it's a vague geographical aspiration.

And don't get us started on stakeholder management. The man actively withholds critical information from his team. He knew about the Balrog. He knew about Saruman. He chose vibes over transparency every single time.

His resource allocation is frankly mystifying. You have access to giant eagles. USE THE EAGLES. This is basic optimization.

Perhaps most damning: his approach to blocked tasks. When faced with a closed door in Moria, his solution was to sit there for hours guessing passwords. No escalation. No workaround documentation. Just "Speak friend and enter" on repeat while the rest of the team watched.

In conclusion, while Gandalf may possess immense magical power and centuries of wisdom, his refusal to adopt modern project management methodologies makes him unemployable in today's agile workplace. His PIP is forthcoming.
