Economists are raising concerns that the rapid expansion of prediction markets has created a new class of investor with a direct financial stake in catastrophic outcomes.

"When millions of people can bet on whether something bad will happen, you've created millions of people who need something bad to happen," said Dr. Eleanor Vance, an economist at a major research university who studies market incentives. "The invisible hand of the market is still guiding capital efficiently. It's just guiding it toward whoever correctly anticipated your suffering."

Prediction markets, which allow participants to wager on future events ranging from elections to natural disasters, have exploded in popularity since regulatory changes in 2024. Proponents argue they aggregate collective intelligence more accurately than traditional forecasting methods.

"Critics fundamentally misunderstand how this works," said Derek Holston, a prediction market analyst who manages a portfolio of disaster-linked positions worth an estimated $2.3 million. "If I bet $50,000 on a recession, I'm not *causing* the recession. I just do very thorough research. Brandon Lutnick and I chat a lot in our Signal group about the bunker we're building in Greenland. We also talk a lot about the future. We're very aligned on the future." He shrugged. "Anyway, I've been having a great year."

Holston noted that his current holdings include positions on three hurricanes, a sovereign debt default, and what he described as "a very promising wildfire situation developing in the Southwest."

Industry advocates maintain that prediction markets simply surface existing information. "The market aggregates data. If that data is everyone's worst fears converted into a financial instrument, that's not manipulation. That's efficiency," said Vanessa Marsh, founder of the Prediction Market Institute.

However, Marsh acknowledged that the industry is evolving. "Frankly, events are becoming less interesting to us. The real alpha is in behavioral futures—betting on how *people* will respond to events. How they'll vote, what they'll buy, when they'll panic."

She confirmed her organization is lobbying for automatic enrollment in prediction markets.

"We want everyone participating," Marsh said. "The more bettors in the system, the more behavior there is to model. We're not really betting on the future anymore." She smiled. "We're betting on you. Specifically. Right now."

She glanced at her phone.

"Don't worry. Whatever you do next, we're positioned for it."

**Format: Experts Warn**

Fear-mongering journalism lends false urgency through credentialed concern. By leading with alarmed academics, the article frames its thesis as established fact before presenting evidence. The experts are vaguely affiliated ("a major research university") but never scrutinized—because scrutiny would slow down the alarm.

**Archetype: Counterintuitive Claim**

Presenting a contrarian thesis, then letting defenders accidentally prove the point. Each rebuttal reinforces the original concern, creating the illusion of balanced debate where one side is unwittingly self-incriminating. Watch for sources who answer different questions than the ones they were asked.

**Fallacy: Appeal to the Market**

A cousin of appeal to nature: the assumption that market outcomes are inherently rational because markets produced them. "The market decided" becomes a thought-terminating cliche that obscures who benefits and who suffers from that efficiency. Markets optimize for what they're designed to optimize for—which isn't always human welfare.

**Constraint: Let Them Hang Themselves**

Rather than editorializing, the piece lets defenders speak in their own words. The horror emerges from their sincerity, not the reporter's commentary—mirroring how real journalism often exposes subjects simply by quoting them accurately.
