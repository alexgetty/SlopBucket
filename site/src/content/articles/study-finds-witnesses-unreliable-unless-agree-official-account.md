A comprehensive study from researchers at a major institution has confirmed what sources familiar with the matter have long suspected: eyewitness testimony is inherently unreliable, except when witnesses corroborate the official version of events.

"To be clear," said the study's lead author, a researcher whose name is being withheld to protect his expertise, "memory is famously malleable. Witnesses misremember details, confuse sequences, and frequently invent entire scenarios. Unless, of course, their account matches ours. In those cases, we've found that memory was remarkably precise."

The peer-reviewed analysis examined 847 witness statements across various incidents and found a strong correlation between testimonial accuracy and alignment with preliminary official accounts. Witnesses who contradicted authority figures demonstrated an 89.3% unreliability rate, while those who supported official narratives achieved near-perfect accuracy scores.

"The science is actually quite straightforward," the researcher explained, sighing audibly. "When someone says they saw something happen one way, and an official spokesperson says it happened another way, we have to weigh the credibility of each source. One of them has a badge and a press release. The other was merely present."

Critics have noted that several witnesses in recent incidents provided sworn testimony directly contradicting official accounts. However, sources familiar with the study pointed out that sworn testimony—while admissible in court—remains subject to the same cognitive biases that make witnesses unreliable in the first place.

"Both sides have valid perspectives," the researcher continued, visibly exhausted. "On one hand, you have multiple corroborating witnesses, video evidence, and physical forensics. On the other, you have a statement from an agency spokesperson. One of these is institutional. One of these is anecdotal."

The study has prompted calls for reform. Proposed legislation would require all future incidents to be witnessed exclusively by federal employees, eliminating the unreliability of civilian observation entirely. A pilot program in Oregon, Minnesota, and Colorado will test "Verified Witness Zones" where only credentialed observers may be present during official actions.

Researchers are also developing a standardized witness assessment form featuring a single question: "Did the official account happen?" Respondents who answer "yes" will be classified as reliable. Those who answer "no" will receive a follow-up questionnaire asking whether they were really there and are certain of what they saw, and advising them to have their papers ready and to remain at their current location until authorities have a chance to pick them up for additional questioning.

**Format: Study Finds**

Academic authority laundering. By framing claims as "research" from unnamed institutions, media grants the weight of science to assertions that wouldn't survive peer review. The methodology is always vague, the researchers always anonymous, and the findings always convenient.

**Archetype: Sources Say Something**

Anonymous sourcing creates an illusion of insider knowledge while eliminating accountability. "Sources familiar with the matter" could be anyone—including someone with a vested interest in the story going a particular way. The attribution sounds credible while being completely unverifiable.

**Fallacy: False Equivalence**

Presenting two things as comparable when they're not. Multiple eyewitnesses with consistent accounts are treated as equivalent to a single official statement, as if both carry equal evidentiary weight. This "both sides" framing obscures obvious power imbalances—then drops the pretense entirely.

**Constraint: Voice: Exhausted Explainer**

The weary sigh encoded in sentences. When basic concepts require constant re-explanation—like "witnesses who saw things may have actually seen things"—the exasperation becomes part of the voice. "To be clear" functions as a pressure valve for frustration.
