*Kyle Brennan, 41, wakes at 4:47 a.m. in a studio apartment in Austin. His morning routine takes 2 hours and 14 minutes. He has not seen his children in eight months.*

"I was tracking everything," Brennan said, gesturing toward a whiteboard covered in hand-drawn graphs. "Sleep latency, HRV, glucose response, ketone levels. But my numbers kept crashing around 4 p.m., and I couldn't figure out why."

The culprit, he discovered, was screen time—specifically, the 47 minutes per day he spent negotiating iPad access with his son and daughter, ages 7 and 9.

"It was a false binary," Brennan explained. "Either I win the screen time battle and destroy my cortisol, or I lose and they get unlimited dopamine poisoning. There's no third option."

There was, he realized, a third option.

Brennan's ex-wife, who declined to be interviewed, was awarded full custody in September. Brennan describes the arrangement as "a co-parenting pivot" and "the single biggest optimization of my protocol stack."

His screen time metrics now hover at zero. He cold-plunges at 5:15 a.m. without interruption. His glucose remains stable through dinner, which he eats alone at 5:30 p.m. before a 12-hour fast.

"I saw this TED talk once about how constraints breed creativity," he said. "Kids are a constraint. I just removed the constraint."

Brennan now spends his former negotiation hours on "deep work"—a term he uses to describe journaling, breathwork, and updating a spreadsheet that tracks his own optimization metrics. He posts his protocols to a Substack with 23 subscribers, mostly other men in the Austin biohacking scene.

When asked if he misses his children, Brennan paused for 4 seconds—he timed it on his Oura ring—before answering.

"I miss the version of them that didn't need a screen," he said. "But that version doesn't exist. The variables were uncontrollable. I'm not equipped to optimize someone else's dopamine."

He showed me to the door at exactly 7:15 a.m., when his "input window" opens.

"I'm happier," he said. "My numbers prove it."

**Format: Profile**

The profile format borrows the vocabulary of documentary journalism—specific times, physical details, neutral observation—to grant legitimacy to its subject. By presenting someone as worthy of a character study, the format implies their choices are interesting rather than monstrous. The interviewer's detachment becomes complicity.

**Archetype: The Biohacker**

Optimization culture treats the self as a system to be debugged. When metrics become the goal, anything unmeasurable becomes noise—including relationships, obligations, and the people who depend on you. The biohacker doesn't lack feeling; he's just found a framework that makes feeling optional.

**Fallacy: False Dichotomy**

"Either I win the screen time battle or they get dopamine poisoning" ignores every option between total control and abandonment. Binary thinking narrows the world until only extreme choices remain visible—and makes drastic action feel logical.

**Constraint: TED Talk Reference**

The invocation of a TED talk as justification launders selfishness through the vocabulary of self-improvement. "Constraints breed creativity" is startup wisdom repurposed to rationalize walking away from fatherhood.
