You have a dog. You walk it. But are you walking it *correctly*?

According to a recent survey of 847 homeowners in planned communities, 91.3% believe their neighbors could benefit from clearer guidance on canine ambulation standards. The remaining 8.7% pretended not to be home when our representative knocked and have been fined accordingly.

**Step 1: Leash Selection**

Retractable leashes allow dogs to wander up to twenty-six feet from their handlers. Twenty-six feet is enough to reach a lawn. We're not saying retractable leashes are prohibited. We're saying we know who uses them.

A standard six-foot lead in an approved neutral tone (gray, navy, or taupe) demonstrates respect for shared spaces. Neon colors suggest a household that may require additional engagement from the Standards Committee.

**Step 2: Route Documentation**

Walk counterclockwise. This is not mandatory. However, our community wellness cameras—installed exclusively for package theft prevention—are calibrated for counterclockwise traffic, and clockwise walkers may appear in incident reports through no fault of our own.

Marjorie Dellwood, our Pedestrian Flow Compliance Liaison, has mapped optimal routes that minimize lawn-adjacent sidewalk time. Residents who prefer alternative paths are welcome to submit a Deviation Request Form (RC-7) explaining their reasoning. These are reviewed annually.

**Step 3: The Elimination Protocol**

Your dog will need to relieve itself. We understand. Biology is not a violation.

Location is. Elimination within fifteen feet of mailboxes, decorative features, or the Hendersons' rhododendrons is prohibited. The Hendersons have documented nineteen incidents since March. They have photographs. They also sit on the Architectural Review Board, which is unrelated but worth knowing.

Waste bags are required. We recommend carrying three—one for use, one for backup, and one visible in your hand at all times so that neighbors can confirm preparedness without asking. This is not surveillance. This is community trust, verified optically.

**Step 4: Incident Response**

If your dog barks, note the time. If it barks twice within a four-minute window, this constitutes a pattern. Patterns are presented at the monthly meeting. Your name is read aloud. Your neighbors attend. This is not a punishment. This is transparency.

First incidents receive a courtesy notice. The courtesy notice is also filed with the county. This is standard practice. If it were punitive, we would not be telling you about it in a guide.

**Step 5: Property Assessment**

Your daily walk creates a predictable window during which your home is unattended. This is noted. Not for any particular reason.

Upon returning, you may find a small flag in your lawn indicating your property was assessed in your absence. Green flags are positive. Yellow flags are informational. Red flags are not placed. Residents who would receive red flags have typically already received a visit.

**Step 6: Community Standing**

Several former residents chose not to follow these guidelines. They eventually decided—independently and of their own free will—that this community was not the right fit. We respected their decision. We also maintain relationships with every realtor within forty miles, and compliance records are a matter of community interest.

We do not expect perfection. We expect participation in the shared understanding that your neighbors are always watching, and that watching is a form of care.

Your dog is welcome here. We have simply noticed that dogs whose owners follow the guidelines tend to live longer, happier lives.

We hope yours does too.

**Format: How-To Guide**

Instructional framing transforms personal preferences into expertise. Numbering steps implies a correct sequence where none exists—suddenly there's a wrong way to do something you've done successfully for years.

**Archetype: Engagement Bait Question**

The opening question isn't seeking answers—it's establishing that you should feel uncertain. Engagement bait works by making readers defensive about things they weren't worried about until asked.

**Fallacy: Appeal to Popularity**

Survey statistics substitute consensus for reasoning. The 91.3% who agree and the 8.7% who've been fined frame disagreement as deviance requiring correction, not difference worth respecting.

**Constraint: HOA President Perspective**

The voice of petty authority dressed as governance. Every "we're not saying" precedes exactly what's being said. Every "this is not" describes precisely what it is. Plausible deniability as communication style—threats delivered as helpful information.
