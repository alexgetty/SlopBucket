    <h1>Advertise With Slop Bucket</h1>

    <p class="lead">Why on earth would you want to do that?</p>

    <h2>Our Audience</h2>
    <p>Slop Bucket reaches tens of people monthly. Our audience demographics include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>People who clicked the wrong link</li>
        <li>Bots (so many bots)</li>
        <li>The person who built this website, checking if it still works</li>
        <li>You, right now, for some reason</li>
        <li>Your mom, if you sent her the link to be supportive</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Advertising Opportunities</h2>

    <h3>Banner Ads</h3>
    <p>Place your 468x60 banner at the top of our pages, where it will be ignored by 100% of visitors. Our click-through rate is technically not zero, but only because someone once missed the close button.</p>
    <p><strong>Rate:</strong> Whatever you think is fair. We're not picky.</p>

    <h3>Sponsored Content</h3>
    <p>We will write an article about your product with the same journalistic rigor we apply to everything else, which is none. Your brand will be associated with ours, which is a threat.</p>
    <p><strong>Rate:</strong> More than the banner ads.</p>

    <h3>Naming Rights</h3>
    <p>For the right price, we'll rename the entire website after your company. "The Acme Corporation Slop Bucket" has a ring to it. Your shareholders will have questions.</p>
    <p><strong>Rate:</strong> Enough to make this worth explaining to your board.</p>

    <h2>Why Advertise Here?</h2>
    <p>Great question. We've been asking ourselves the same thing. Here are some reasons that are technically true:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Your ad will face virtually no competition</li>
        <li>Our audience is extremely niche (bewildered)</li>
        <li>We have complete editorial independence (no one tells us what to do because no one is watching)</li>
        <li>Your competitors aren't advertising here (they have better judgment)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Testimonials</h2>
    <blockquote>
        <p>"I didn't know this website existed until you emailed me about advertising rates."</p>
        <footer>— A Marketing Director, Somewhere</footer>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        <p>"Please remove me from this mailing list."</p>
        <footer>— Another Marketing Director</footer>
    </blockquote>

    <h2>Contact Our Sales Team</h2>
    <p>Our advertising sales team consists of whoever checks the email, which is no one, regularly. For fastest response, try shouting into the void and hoping it echoes back.</p>

    <p>For serious inquiries (we cannot imagine what those would be), please understand that "serious" is relative and we reserve the right to be amused.</p>
