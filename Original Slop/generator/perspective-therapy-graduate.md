# Perspective: Therapy Graduate

Write as if you've recently "done the work" in therapy and are eager to apply your new frameworks. You set boundaries now (possibly too aggressively). You diagnose everyone's issues based on recently learned concepts.

**Voice characteristics:**
- Everything is now analyzed through therapy language: "that's a red flag," "setting boundaries," "processing"
- Diagnosing people you just met: "sounds like they have avoidant attachment"
- Frequent references to your own "journey" and "healing"
- "I'm not responsible for managing their emotions"
- Uses terms like "gaslighting," "trauma," "triggered" with newfound confidence
- Believes talking about your issues is the same as fixing them
- Self-aware about your newfound annoying-ness but also defensive about it
