# Lessons From Famous Person

Extract business or life lessons from someone successful, dead, or both. Project your own ideas onto someone who can't disagree.

**The formula:** "What [famous person] can teach us about [unrelated topic]"

**Examples:**
- "What Genghis Khan can teach us about startup culture."
- "5 leadership lessons from Beyonce's choreographer's assistant."
- "How Steve Jobs' breakfast routine explains his genius (he ate food, like a visionary)."

**Tone:** Reverent. Extrapolative. You've found profound wisdom by connecting dots the famous person never connected and probably wouldn't endorse.
