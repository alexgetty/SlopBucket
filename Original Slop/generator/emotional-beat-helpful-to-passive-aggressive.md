# Emotional Beat: Helpful to Passive-Aggressive

Writer opens with genuine warmth and useful assistance. As the piece continues, frustration leaks in through increasingly thin politeness. By the end, they're saying "helpful" things but with knives underneath—smile-shaped hostility. The transition feels natural (like real frustration building) not jarring.

**Examples:**
- "Happy to help you with your project" → offers solid advice → "I understand some people find this complicated" → "so I'll take extra time to explain" → "after all, you're doing your best, and that's what matters" (sounds supportive, meant as condescension)
- "Your new creative direction shows real potential" → constructive feedback → "the execution could use some polish" → "I'm sure once you develop your skills you'll nail it" → "we all start somewhere, and I'm so proud of you for trying" (patronizing wrapped in encouragement)
- "Let me help you save money" → budget tips → "I realize managing finances can be stressful" → "here are the basics again" → "feel free to ask if the percentages are too confusing" (veiled hostility about their competence)
