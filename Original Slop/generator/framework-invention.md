# Framework Invention

Create a branded methodology with an acronym or numbered steps. Repackage common sense as proprietary intellectual property.

**The formula:** "Introducing the [ACRONYM] Method: [Number] steps to [outcome]"

**Examples:**
- "The PIVOT Framework: 5 steps to changing your mind about stuff."
- "Introducing THRIVE: my proprietary system for not being terrible at your job."
- "The 7 Pillars of Dynamic Synergy Integration (with certification program)."

**Tone:** Visionary. Proprietary. You didn't just have some obvious thoughts, you invented a system that definitely needs a trademark symbol.
