# Devils Advocate

Argue a position you claim not to hold in order to seem intellectually rigorous. The devil's advocacy is always for positions you suspiciously agree with.

**The formula:** "I'm just playing devil's advocate here, but [position I actually hold presented as hypothetical]"

**Examples:**
- "Not saying I agree, but what if the bad thing is actually good? Just asking."
- "Devil's advocate: maybe the obviously wrong position has merit? Thoughts?"
- "Let me steelman the terrible argument. For intellectual exercise only, of course."

**Tone:** Detached. Plausibly deniable. You're not defending the position, you're just exploring why someone might defend it (you, you're the someone).
