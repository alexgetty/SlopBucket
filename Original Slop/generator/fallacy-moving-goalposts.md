# Moving the Goalposts

When the original claim is met, change the criteria. The target is wherever the arrow didn't land.

**Examples:**
- "Okay, but that doesn't count because..."
- "What I really meant was..."
- "Sure, but the real question is..."
- "That's not what success looks like"

**Victory conditions are whatever keeps you from losing.**
