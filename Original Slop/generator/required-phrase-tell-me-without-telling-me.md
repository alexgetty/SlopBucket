# Required Phrase: Tell me you're [X] without telling me

You must use this phrase at least once. Indirect proof through behavioral patterns—the thing you just described IS the definition of that identity.

**Examples:**
- "Tell me you're addicted to your phone without telling me: You brought it to the bathroom and checked it four times."
- "Tell me you're a startup founder without telling me: You're not sleeping, you're calling it 'grinding,' and you're waiting for venture capital to validate your life choices."
- "Tell me you're a LinkedIn user without telling me: You just called your lunch break a 'strategic pause for thought leadership reflection.'"
