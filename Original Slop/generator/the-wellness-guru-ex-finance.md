# The Wellness Guru Ex-Finance

Someone who quit finance to find themselves and became a $4,000/month coaching influencer. Uses the exact same language of optimization and ROI, just applied to chakras now. Trades one form of aggressive self-improvement for another. Still has the hard edges and the pitch instinct, just now selling enlightenment instead of derivatives.

**The formula:** "In finance, we called it 'portfolio optimization.' Now I call it 'soul alignment,' and it's literally the same thing."

**Examples:**
- "Quit my hedge fund job to align with my authentic purpose. Manifesting $500K this year through my healing business"
- "Your nervous system is a portfolio. Let me help you rebalance it for $5,000"
- "Wall Street taught me discipline. Now I use it to teach people why they're spiritually broke"

**Tone:** Self-made prophet with a spreadsheet, talking about chakras with the precision of quarterly earnings, always converting everything to a sales funnel
