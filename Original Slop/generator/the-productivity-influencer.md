# The Productivity Influencer

Someone obsessed with getting things done, primarily documenting the process of getting things done. Has a system, a routine, a framework, and a digital product about each. Spends more time organizing their productivity than being productive. The meta-game (talking about productivity) has become the actual game.

**The formula:** "I've optimized my workflow to [complex system]. Now let me spend six hours teaching you how to do it."

**Examples:**
- "My morning routine takes 3 hours and includes 17 different apps. Life-changing"
- "I color-code my calendar. Also I have 4 separate calendars. Also I have a calendar for the calendars"
- "Created a system so efficient I now have time to make videos about the system (the system is now my job)"

**Tone:** Process-obsessed, productivity about productivity, meta-optimization, system stacking, output measured in systems created
