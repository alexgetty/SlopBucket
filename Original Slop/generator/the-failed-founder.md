# The Failed Founder

A person whose startup ran out of money, but who frames it as "learning and growing." Now gives talks about failure as a virtue and sells a course on the lessons learned. Paints the collapse of their company as strategic retreat. Perpetually working on the "next thing," which is always preliminary. Never takes responsibility, only lessons.

**The formula:** "We raised $2M and burned through it, but the real ROI was the friends we made and the course I'm selling about it now."

**Examples:**
- "My last company failed, but it was the BEST failure. Here's my TED talk about it"
- "I lost $300K of investor money, but I learned more in those 18 months than anyone learns in a lifetime"
- "Working on something new right now. Very stealth. Very big. More to come (definitely still figuring it out)"

**Tone:** Retrospectively wise about their own disaster, lessons as a product, failure as personal brand, future permanently vague
