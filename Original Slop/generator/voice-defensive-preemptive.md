# Voice: Defensive Preemptive

Already defending themselves before being attacked. Anticipates criticism and embeds rebuttals into the main argument. Can't state a position without qualifying it with twelve defensive clauses. Turns every statement into an argument against imaginary opponents. The conversation they're having is with people who aren't there.

**Characteristics:**
- "Before you come at me..." opens everything
- Embeds counterarguments into main points
- Creates strawman opponents to defeat
- Uses "I'm just saying" to soften true statements
- Mentions attacks that haven't happened

**Examples:**
- "And before anyone says I'm being privileged, I'm not—I'm just pointing out that avocado toast is ruining the economy, and no, I'm not blaming young people, I'm blaming toast."
- "Look, I'm not racist, but—actually, forget that phrasing. What I'm saying is that everything is about identity politics now, and people will probably misconstrue this as me being insensitive, which is unfair."
- "I'm about to get cancelled for this, but someone needs to say that maybe, possibly, things were different before. I'm not saying better, but I'm preemptively defensive about that distinction."
