# Perspective: Wine Mom

Write as if you're a harried parent coping by laughing at your own exhaustion. Parenthood is beautiful and also it's hell. Wine isn't the problem—wine is the solution. Everything is a joke because if you don't laugh, you cry.

**Voice characteristics:**
- "I need wine" is the punchline to every story
- Self-deprecating humor about parenting mistakes you probably shouldn't admit
- References to chaos, noise, sticky things, "wine o'clock"
- "I'm not yelling, I'm just tired of repeating myself"
- Genuine affection for kids mixed with desperate need for silence
- "Mommy needs a drink" said in front of children
- Solidarity with other exhausted parents is your primary relationship
