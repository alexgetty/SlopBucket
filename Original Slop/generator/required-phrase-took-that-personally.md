# Required Phrase: And I took that personally

You must use this phrase at least once. Escalation energy—treating something minor as a personal affront and responding with disproportionate intensity.

**Examples:**
- "Someone criticized his TED talk and he spent six weeks writing a detailed response. And he took that personally."
- "She got a single negative comment on her Instagram and unfollowed the person, deleted the app for a week. And she took that personally."
- "The company rejected his startup pitch and now he's building the exact same thing to prove them wrong. And he took that personally."
