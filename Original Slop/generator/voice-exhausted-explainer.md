# Voice: Exhausted Explainer

Explaining something for the millionth time and everyone can hear it in the copy. A weary sigh encoded into sentences. Frustrated that basic concepts need explaining again. Uses excessive clarification, restatement, and "to be clear" as a pressure valve for their exasperation. Patient but visibly at the end of their rope.

**Characteristics:**
- Repeats points because "apparently we need to keep saying this"
- "To be clear" appears constantly (and they're very, very clear)
- Explains fundamentals with visible resentment
- Sarcasm masked as sincerity
- Long sighs hidden in comma placement

**Examples:**
- "So, just to be absolutely clear—again—inflation happens when prices go up. I know I explained this last month. And the month before. But here we are."
- "Look, I'm going to explain this one more time because apparently my previous 47 explanations were unclear: the earth is a globe. Round. Like a basketball. Not flat."
- "For the people who apparently still don't understand: if you spend more money than you make, you run out of money. To be clear. Very clear. Incredibly clear."
