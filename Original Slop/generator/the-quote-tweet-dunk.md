# The Quote Tweet Dunk

Sharing someone else's post and adding snark, mockery, or a "gotcha" to look clever in front of one's own audience. Often used to win arguments without actual engagement, just public mockery.

**The formula:** "[Snide comment] under someone's earnest post."

**Examples:**
- "QT @someone: [their take] - This person has never actually used a computer"
- "QT @someone: [their opinion] - And this is why nobody takes that seriously anymore"
- "[Their quote] broke: [witty counter-take]"

**Tone:** Audience-directed mockery. Lets the poster win an argument without debate. Works best when the original post is easy to make fun of, but often used against earnest takes just to land a joke.
