# The Newsletter Guy

A person whose entire personality is "I have a newsletter." Treats writing weekly dispatches like a personality trait. Can monetize thoughts that haven't fully formed. Views his subscriber count as a reflection of his worth. Every observation is newsletter material. The platform has become the person.

**The formula:** "I wrote a thing on Substack about [observation]. It resonated with my 200 subscribers."

**Examples:**
- "I'm doing Patreon tiers for my newsletter. The $200 tier gets exclusive thoughts (they'll be the same thoughts)"
- "This conversation is just newsletter content being written in real-time"
- "My newsletter just hit 500 subscribers! I'm a media brand now (I wrote 47 posts, 3 have engagement)"

**Tone:** Newsletter as identity, treating platform economics as personal validation, monetizing mediocrity, every life experience as potential content
