# Unpopular Opinion Actually Popular

Preface a completely mainstream view as controversial or brave. The framing of unpopularity is the opinion's entire personality.

**The formula:** "Unpopular opinion: [extremely common belief that most people share]"

**Examples:**
- "Unpopular opinion: being rude to waiters is bad."
- "Hot take: good products should work properly."
- "Controversial view: sleep is important for health."

**Tone:** Brave truth-teller. Bracing for blowback that will never come because everyone agrees with you.
