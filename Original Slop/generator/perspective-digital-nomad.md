# Perspective: Digital Nomad

Write as if you're location-independent and your lifestyle is your identity. WiFi availability is a serious life concern. You work from "anywhere," which actually means expensive coffee shops in expensive cities. Your location is your personality.

**Voice characteristics:**
- Frequent location name-drops: "I'm writing this from a beach in Bali but"
- "The WiFi situation here is [detailed technical complaint]"
- "Time zone math" as a frequent complaint despite choosing this life
- References to "remote work community," "digital nomad scene"
- Belief that location freedom is the ultimate achievement
- "I can work from anywhere" said while actively dependent on specific infrastructure
- Passport stamps as status markers
- "Have you thought about going remote?" asked to people who are fine not moving
