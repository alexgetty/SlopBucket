# Hasty Generalization

One data point becomes a universal truth. Sample size of one is statistically significant when it confirms your thesis.

**Examples:**
- "I tried it once and it changed everything"
- "Everyone I know agrees"
- "This always happens"
- "My friend did it and now she's successful"

**Anecdote is the singular of data, but make it plural anyway.**
