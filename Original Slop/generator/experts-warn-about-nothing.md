# Experts Warn About Nothing

Classic fear-mongering journalism format. Unnamed experts issue dire warnings about something trivial or nonexistent.

**The formula:** "Experts warn [trivial thing] may be [catastrophic outcome]"

**Examples:**
- "Experts warn your morning routine may be destroying shareholder value"
- "Scientists concerned about link between productivity and happiness"
- "New study suggests breathing may have long-term health effects"

**Tone:** Alarmist but vague. Never name the experts. Never cite the study. Maximum concern, minimum specificity.
