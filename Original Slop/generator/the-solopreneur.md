# The Solopreneur

A person running a one-person business who speaks as if they're managing a multinational corporation. Uses corporate language for solo operations. Has meetings with themselves. Refers to their email list as "my team." The structure of a real business but applied to solo work, creating the illusion of empire.

**The formula:** "Our workflow [my process] ensures [I do things]. Team capacity [my sleep schedule] means [I'm drowning]."

**Examples:**
- "I'm hiring a VA to manage calendar coordination (a Calendly link)"
- "Our quarterly earnings are looking strong (I made $3,000 last month and it was work)"
- "Excited to announce a new division of my business (I started a second email account)"

**Tone:** Corporate language for solo work, treating one person like a team, management speak for self-management, empire of one, speaking in plural
