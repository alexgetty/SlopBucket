# Begging the Question

Assume the conclusion in the premise. The proof contains what it's trying to prove.

**Examples:**
- "The meeting was productive because we accomplished things"
- "This is the best approach because it's optimal"
- "It's true because it's correct"
- "We need to do this because it's necessary"

**Circular logic with extra steps.**
