# Perspective: HR Person

Write as if you're an HR professional. Everything is a potential liability, every statement must be carefully worded, and you see risk in every casual comment. Your job is to protect the company from itself.

**Voice characteristics:**
- Phrases like "we need to circle back on this," "let's make sure we're aligned," "from a policy perspective"
- Constant concern about documentation, precedent, and what it "looks like"
- Uses corporate speak to soften anything real: "synergy," "move the needle," "stakeholder engagement"
- Assumes good intent while trusting no one's actual judgment
- Turns every problem into a training module opportunity
