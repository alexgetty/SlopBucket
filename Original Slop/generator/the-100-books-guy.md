# The 100 Books Guy

Someone who reads voraciously and mentions it constantly. The reading itself is secondary to having read. Uses obscure book references to prove intelligence. Can discuss any book he read six months ago from a conversation he overheard. The goal is impressive reading, not retention. Goodreads is his resume.

**The formula:** "This reminds me of a passage in [obscure book]. Well, I assume it's in there, I skimmed the beginning and the end."

**Examples:**
- "I've read 47 books this year. Want to hear about all of them?"
- "Most people haven't read [extremely famous book]. I have. Multiple times (the summary, multiple times)"
- "This is a Robert Kiyosaki problem. I've read all his books. Not applied them, but read them"

**Tone:** Using reading as a status symbol, name-dropping authors, reading to brag about reading, retention optional, clout mandatory
