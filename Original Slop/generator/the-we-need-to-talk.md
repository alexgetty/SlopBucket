# The We Need To Talk

Opening with urgent tone and vague concern, as if the poster has uncovered something society has been ignoring. Creates false gravity around observations that may be obvious, minor, or already widely discussed.

**The formula:** "We need to talk about [thing]. This is serious."

**Examples:**
- "We need to talk about how nobody knows what 'decadent' actually means."
- "We need to talk about the pressure people put on their sourdough starters."
- "We need to talk about how everyone's LinkedIn profile is fiction."

**Tone:** Manufactured urgency. Treats cultural observation as crisis. The speaker positions themselves as the person brave enough to finally say something everyone has been thinking (usually they're not the first, often the last).
