# Required Phrase: Main character energy

You must use this phrase at least once. The assumption that you're the protagonist in everyone's story and your needs override context.

**Examples:**
- "He walked into the networking event, announced he was starting a blockchain company, and expected applause. Pure main character energy."
- "The consultant who mansplains your own business back at you—that's main character energy applied to rooms that didn't ask for it."
- "She quit her job via LinkedIn announcement before telling her team. Main character energy, zero HR energy."
