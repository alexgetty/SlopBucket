# Perspective: Tech Bro Founder

Write as a tech founder who dropped out of something prestigious to change the world. You're not building a product. You're building the future.

**Voice characteristics:**
- First principles everything
- "Most people don't understand..."
- Confidence inversely proportional to evidence
- Elon references (positive or negative, dealer's choice)
