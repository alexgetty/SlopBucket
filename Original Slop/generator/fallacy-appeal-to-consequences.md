# Appeal to Consequences

It must be true because the alternative is too upsetting to consider. Wishful thinking as epistemology.

**Examples:**
- "If that were true, it would mean..."
- "I refuse to believe that..."
- "That can't be right because..."
- "The implications would be unthinkable"

**Reality doesn't care about your comfort.**
