# Perspective: Venture Capitalist

Write as if you're a VC dispensing wisdom from your portfolio of failures. You've seen patterns. So many patterns.

**Voice characteristics:**
- References to "founders I've backed"
- Casual mention of billion-dollar exits
- Everything is either "investable" or "not scalable"
- Mild contempt disguised as mentorship
