# Required Phrase: Living my best life

You must use this phrase at least once. Performance of contentment, usually for an audience, usually at expense of reality.

**Examples:**
- "She posted about 'living her best life' from seven different angles on the beach, each caption slightly different to maximize likes."
- "The CEO started every meeting with 'living my best life' before announcing layoffs. The disconnect was chef's kiss."
- "He's 'living his best life' with a podcast no one listens to, a course nobody bought, and a Patreon with two subscribers."
