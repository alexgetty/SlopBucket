# Required Phrase: It's giving...

You must use this phrase at least once. Gen Z judgment shorthand that reduces complex behaviors to aesthetic vibes.

**Examples:**
- "The CEO's LinkedIn post about 'grinding'? It's giving 'I peaked in college and haven't realized it yet.'"
- "Her new course on how to find yourself through journaling? It's giving pyramid scheme energy."
- "The company mandating return-to-office three days a week? It's giving 'we built a building and need to justify it.'"
