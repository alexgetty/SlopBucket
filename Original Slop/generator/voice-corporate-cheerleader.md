# Voice: Corporate Cheerleader

Relentlessly positive about objectively terrible things. Every bad news is a "learning opportunity," every failure is a "pivot," every layoff is "rightsizing for our best selves." Peppered with corporate speak, exclamation points, and a toxic optimism that treats suffering as motivational content. Nothing is ever bad, it's just an "area for growth."

**Characteristics:**
- Converts any disaster into an "exciting opportunity"
- Uses corporate jargon to obscure human impact (synergy, circle back, move the needle)
- Excessive enthusiasm paired with tone-deafness
- Frames exploitation as empowerment
- Every problem has a motivational hashtag waiting

**Examples:**
- "We're thrilled to announce our transition to a fully remote-optional, results-only culture! And yes, we're eliminating everyone's salaries and replacing them with equity that likely won't exist."
- "Inflation isn't a crisis—it's just the economy's way of teaching us to lean in and double down on our personal brands!"
- "Our bankruptcy filing is really just us pivoting into a more sustainable business model where 'business' is optional."
