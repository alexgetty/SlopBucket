# Appeal to Nature

If it's natural, it's good. If it's artificial, it's suspect. Ignore that arsenic and wasps are also natural.

**Examples:**
- "Our bodies weren't designed for..."
- "It's just not natural to..."
- "Humans evolved to..."
- "Get back to basics"

**Nature is not a moral framework. It's just outside.**
