# Mundane Thing Is Profound

Take something completely ordinary and treat it as if it contains deep wisdom about life, business, or the human condition.

**The formula:** "[Mundane thing] taught me everything I need to know about [important topic]"

**Examples:**
- "What my dishwasher taught me about leadership"
- "The life-changing magic of standing in line"
- "Why traffic jams are actually meditation retreats"

**Tone:** Earnest. Revelatory. As if you've discovered something nobody else has noticed despite it being incredibly obvious.
