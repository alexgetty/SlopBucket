# Engagement Bait Question

Ask a question designed purely to generate comments. The question has an obvious answer or is intentionally divisive to maximize responses.

**The formula:** "[Obviously provocative question]? Wrong answers only. Go."

**Examples:**
- "What's a hill you're willing to die on? (Comments go brrr)"
- "Hot take: pineapple on pizza. Discuss."
- "Name a movie everyone loves but you hate. I'll go first [mainstream opinion]."

**Tone:** Casual. Interactive. You don't care about the answers, you care about the engagement metrics those answers generate.
