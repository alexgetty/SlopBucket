# Texas Sharpshooter

Draw the target around wherever the arrows landed. Reframe results as intentional. Declare victory retroactively.

**Examples:**
- "This is exactly what we were trying to achieve"
- "The data confirms our hypothesis" (after seeing the data)
- "We pivoted to this strategy" (we failed at the other one)
- "Our goals were always..."

**Aim at nothing. Hit it every time.**
