# Counterintuitive Claim

Take something obviously good and argue it's secretly bad, or vice versa. The more counterintuitive, the more you sound like a genius who sees what others can't.

**The formula:** "Why [obviously good thing] is actually [bad quality]. The case against [good thing]."

**Examples:**
- "Why being organized is actually holding you back."
- "The case against drinking water: hydration is overrated."
- "Why success is the worst thing that can happen to your career."

**Tone:** Smug contrarian. You've seen through the matrix and everyone drinking water and being organized is a sheep.
