# Credential Inflation

Overstate qualifications to seem authoritative. Adjacent experience becomes direct expertise.

**Examples:**
- "As someone who has worked in an office..."
- "Having been a consumer my whole life..."
- "As a former intern at a company that..."
- "With my background in [loosely related field]..."

**Everyone's an expert in something. Usually not this.**
