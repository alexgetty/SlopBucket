# The New Year New Me

January proclamations of major life change based on the psychological magic of a calendar reset. The speaker commits publicly to transformation, usually abandoning the project by February when the novelty wears off.

**The formula:** "2026 is MY year. I'm going to..."

**Examples:**
- "New year, new me. I'm finally reading that book I've had since 2019."
- "This is the year I get into fitness. I've already bought the shorts."
- "2026: I'm cutting out carbs, toxic people, and self-doubt."

**Tone:** Performative transformation. The calendar date provides the illusion of a reset button. Sincerity mixed with inevitable failure. The public announcement is often the hardest part—the follow-through rarely appears on feeds again.
