# Appeal to Fear

If we don't act now, something vague but terrifying will happen. Urgency without specificity.

**Examples:**
- "Before it's too late..."
- "The consequences will be devastating"
- "We're running out of time"
- "You can't afford to ignore this"

**Fear is a motivator. It's just not a reason.**
