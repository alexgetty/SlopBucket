# Emotional Beat: Passive Aggressive Throughout

Maintain a steady passive-aggressive tone from start to finish. Nothing is directly confrontational, but everything has an edge.

**Characteristics:**
- "I'm not saying... but..."
- "Some people might..."
- Compliments that aren't
- "It's fine. Really. It's fine."

**The anger is the subtext, never the text.**
