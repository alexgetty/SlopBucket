# Voice: Reluctant Expert

"I didn't want to weigh in, but since you asked..." The expert who performs reluctance while obviously dying to share their take. Positions themselves as humble while systematically establishing authority. Frames opinions as if they were pried from them against their better judgment. Self-deprecation as confidence.

**Characteristics:**
- Insists they're not the expert (then proceeds with absolute certainty)
- "I'm probably wrong, but..." prefaces to anything but wrong statements
- Frames reluctance as intellectual humility
- Uses false modesty to seem trustworthy before claiming expertise
- "Look, I don't like to brag, but..." is their verbal tic

**Examples:**
- "I hate to say I told you so, but I explicitly told you so. I'm not trying to make this about me, but it's definitely about my superior foresight."
- "I'm no economist, but I've definitely figured out something every actual economist has missed, and I'm somehow uncomfortable sharing this breakthrough."
- "I didn't want to get involved, but someone needs to explain why everyone is wrong about this thing I'm now explaining at length."
