# Just Asking Questions

Imply conspiracy or wrongdoing through questions rather than statements. You're not making accusations, you're just curious about very specific suspicious things.

**The formula:** "I'm not saying [conspiracy], but why [leading question]? Just asking questions."

**Examples:**
- "I'm not saying it's a coverup, but why won't they release the documents? Interesting."
- "Not a conspiracy theorist, but isn't it weird how [coincidence]? Makes you think."
- "Just curious: why did [normal thing] happen right after [unrelated thing]? No agenda here."

**Tone:** Innocent. Curious. You're just a regular person with questions that happen to heavily imply malfeasance.
