# Format: Made-Up Statistic

Include at least one completely fabricated statistic. Specificity implies credibility.

**Examples:**
- "73% of leaders agree..."
- "Studies show that 4 out of 5..."
- "Productivity increased by 340%..."
- "87% of people who read this will scroll past..."

**Pro tip:** The more specific the number, the more believable. 73% beats "most."
