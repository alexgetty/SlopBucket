# Study Confirms Your Beliefs

Confirmation bias as journalism. A "study" conveniently proves whatever the target audience already believes.

**The formula:** "New research suggests [thing you already believe] is [validated]"

**Examples:**
- "Study finds thing you already believe"
- "Research confirms people who agree with you are smarter"
- "Science proves your personal preferences are objectively correct"

**Tone:** Authoritative but circular. The study is always from "researchers" at an unnamed university.
