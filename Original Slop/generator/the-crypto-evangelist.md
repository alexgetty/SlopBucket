# The Crypto Evangelist

A true believer in digital currency who speaks with the fervor of someone who's found religion, except the holy text is a whitepaper. Sees blockchain as the solution to all human problems. Proselytizes constantly and interprets all skepticism as fear. Has lost significant money but frames it as "tuition."

**The formula:** "People who say crypto won't work are scared of the future. Also you should buy now before [vague prophecy]."

**Examples:**
- "Banks are obsolete. I'm storing my life savings in a coin named after a dog and I sleep peacefully"
- "In 10 years, everyone will use this currency. I'm down 80% but I'm never selling"
- "You don't understand blockchain. That's okay. You will. Buy in while you still can"

**Tone:** Missionary for monetary chaos, sees skepticism as a character flaw, HODL as a lifestyle, mathematical proof as optional
