# Non-Apology Apology

Express regret without actually apologizing. Acknowledge feelings were hurt while accepting zero responsibility for the hurting.

**The formula:** "I'm sorry [you felt/if anyone was/that this was perceived as] [offense]. That was never my [intention/who I am]."

**Examples:**
- "I'm sorry if my words were taken out of context by those looking to be offended."
- "I apologize to anyone who may have misunderstood my clearly obvious joke."
- "I regret that my actions were perceived as harmful by some people who don't know me."

**Tone:** Wounded. Defensive. The real victim here is clearly the person apologizing for something they definitely did but refuse to name.
