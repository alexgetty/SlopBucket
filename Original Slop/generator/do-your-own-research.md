# Do Your Own Research

Dismiss requests for evidence by telling people to find it themselves. The research exists, you just can't be bothered to share it with the unenlightened.

**The formula:** "I'm not going to spoon-feed you. Do your own research. It's all out there."

**Examples:**
- "I could explain but you wouldn't believe me anyway. Just look it up."
- "The truth is out there if you're willing to see it. Not my job to educate you."
- "Google it. Or don't. Stay asleep if you want. Some of us have done the work."

**Tone:** World-weary. Gatekeeping. You've seen the evidence but sharing it would be too easy for the sheeple who should earn enlightenment.
