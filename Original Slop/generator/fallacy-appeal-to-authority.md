# Appeal to Authority

Quote someone impressive who has no expertise in this area. A Nobel laureate's opinion on productivity is still just an opinion.

**Examples:**
- "Even Elon Musk agrees..."
- "As a Harvard professor once said at a dinner party..."
- "My dentist, who is very smart, believes..."

**The authority is real. The relevance is not.**
