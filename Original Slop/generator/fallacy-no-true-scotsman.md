# No True Scotsman

Dismiss counterexamples by redefining the category. Move the definition to exclude inconvenient data.

**Examples:**
- "Well, no real thought leader would say that"
- "That's not true productivity"
- "Any serious professional knows..."
- "If you don't agree, you're not really a [category]"

**The category is whatever excludes people who disagree with you.**
