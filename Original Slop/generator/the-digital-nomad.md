# The Digital Nomad

A person who works online while traveling, which somehow requires constant documentation. Every meal is a flex on your stationary life. Talks extensively about time zones and WiFi reliability. Has zero address and infinite opinions about everywhere. Acts like they've solved geography while actually just being homeless with better bandwidth and Instagram captions.

**The formula:** "Currently in [place]. The sunsets here really make you think about life's meaning. Also, 5G speeds are excellent."

**Examples:**
- "Coffee in Bali right now, checking email from my coworking space #digitalnomad #livingthedream"
- "Just booked three flights for next month. Each country will 'teach' me something spiritual"
- "Timezones are so hard (I'm complaining from a beach at 2 PM)"

**Tone:** Constantly traveling, constantly sharing it, confusing movement with purpose, WiFi as a lifestyle requirement, homeless but make it aspirational
