# Cherry-Picked Data Point

Select one statistic that supports your argument while ignoring all context and contradicting data. The number proves everything because you chose it specifically to prove everything.

**The formula:** "[Single decontextualized statistic]. The numbers don't lie."

**Examples:**
- "Crime went down 2% this month. Proof that [my policy] works. Ignore the 40% increase last year."
- "This company's stock rose 0.5% on Tuesday. Clear market winner."
- "Studies show 73% of people prefer [thing]. (The study was from 1987 and asked 12 people.)"

**Tone:** Data-driven. Irrefutable. You have numbers on your side and numbers are science, even when they're not.
