# Let Me Explain Mansplainer

Explain something to someone who clearly already knows it, often better than you do. Assume ignorance and provide unsolicited education.

**The formula:** "So basically [explanation of thing the person already understands, often to the expert in that thing]"

**Examples:**
- "[To published author] So basically, books are these things with pages that tell stories..."
- "[To NASA engineer] Let me break down how rockets work in simple terms you might understand."
- "[To surgeon] The heart is like a pump, see, and it pumps blood. Does that make sense?"

**Tone:** Helpful. Patronizing. You're doing them a favor by explaining their own expertise to them.
