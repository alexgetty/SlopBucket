# Required Phrase: The vibes are off

You must use this phrase at least once. Vague unease expressed as specific judgment, usually without evidence required.

**Examples:**
- "The startup's new CEO seems great, but the vibes are off. Something about how she said 'disruption.'"
- "The vibes were off the moment they rebranded from 'consulting' to 'transformation architecture.'"
- "His podcast was fine until episode 47. The vibes are off now. I can't explain why. I just know."
