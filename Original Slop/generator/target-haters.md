# Target: Your Haters

Write directly to the people who doubted you. They were wrong. You were right. This is the receipts.

**Characteristics:**
- "Everyone said I couldn't..."
- "To everyone who doubted..."
- Victory lap disguised as reflection
- Forgiveness that's actually gloating

**You're not mad. You're just successful.**
