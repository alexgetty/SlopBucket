## Full Prompt Assembly for Selected Headline

### Format: Breaking News
```markdown
# Breaking News

Urgent, breathless coverage of something that absolutely does not warrant it. The BREAKING tag implies immediacy and importance. The content delivers neither.

## Headline Templates

- "BREAKING: [Mundane Event Stated Dramatically]"
- "BREAKING: [Authority Figure] Confirms [Obvious Thing]"
- "DEVELOPING: [Situation] Continues To Be [Same Situation]"
- "JUST IN: [Non-News Framed As News]"
- "BREAKING: Sources Confirm [Vague Claim]"
- "URGENT: [Minor Inconvenience] Reaches Crisis Point"
- "BREAKING: [Thing] Officially [What It Already Was]"
- "LIVE UPDATES: [Static Situation] Remains Unchanged"

## Example Headlines

- "BREAKING: Local Man Has Opinion"
- "DEVELOPING: Meeting Could Have Been Email, Sources Confirm"
- "JUST IN: Area Woman 'Fine' Despite Saying Otherwise"
- "BREAKING: Study Finds Thing You Already Believed"
- "URGENT: Reply-All Chain Enters Third Hour"

## Article Structure

- Lead paragraph: State the "news" with maximum gravity
- Quote from unnamed source or expert
- Background context that adds nothing
- Developing updates that don't develop
- End with "This is a developing story" despite nothing developing
```

### Archetype: Breathless Coverage of Non-Event
```markdown
# Breathless Coverage of Non-Event

Breaking news energy applied to something that absolutely does not warrant it. DEVELOPING. EXCLUSIVE. JUST IN.

**The formula:** "BREAKING: [Completely mundane occurrence]"

**Examples:**
- "BREAKING: Local man has opinion"
- "DEVELOPING: Situation continues to be situation"
- "EXCLUSIVE: We aggregated these tweets so you don't have to"

**Tone:** Urgent. Hysterical. As if civilization hangs in the balance over whether someone's take was good.
```

### Fallacy: Appeal to Authority
```markdown
# Appeal to Authority

Quote someone impressive who has no expertise in this area. A Nobel laureate's opinion on productivity is still just an opinion.

**Examples:**
- "Even Elon Musk agrees..."
- "As a Harvard professor once said at a dinner party..."
- "My dentist, who is very smart, believes..."

**The authority is real. The relevance is not.**
```

### Constraint: Required Phrase (Low-Hanging Fruit)
```markdown
# Required Phrase: Low-Hanging Fruit

You must mention "low-hanging fruit." The orchard of corporate mediocrity.

**Examples:**
- "Let's start with the low-hanging fruit"
- "These are the low-hanging fruit opportunities"
- "We've already picked all the low-hanging fruit"
```

### Subject: Mental Health Funding
```markdown
# Mental Health Funding

Federal programs for mental health and addiction treatment that exist in a quantum state of being simultaneously "a national priority" and "unfortunately not in the budget this year." Often described as "important" by the same people eliminating it.

**Keywords:** addiction, treatment, grants, federal funding, SAMHSA, behavioral health, opioid crisis, budget cuts
```

### Generation Instructions
```
Write a 400-800 word satirical article using the selected headline and the above components.

Requirements:
- Use the Breaking News format structure (BREAKING tag, unnamed sources, "developing story" closer)
- Apply the Breathless Coverage archetype (crisis energy for bureaucratic non-events)
- Employ the Appeal to Authority fallacy (unnamed officials, vague expertise)
- Include the required phrase "low-hanging fruit" in official quotes, not narration
- Draw on the Mental Health Funding subject context
- Maintain completely straight-faced AP-style news voice
- The gravitas IS the joke - play it deadpan
- End with an educational "How We Made This Up" section explaining each satirical dimension
```
