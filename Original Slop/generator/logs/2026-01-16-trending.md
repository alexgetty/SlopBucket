## User Selection

**Selected:** #3 (Social Media Ban topic)

**Revised after feedback:** Original headline had logical flaw (a ban can't "parent" — it's an absence, not an agent). Revised to:

> "Australia's Social Media Ban Enters Second Month; Parents Report Children Now 'Just Sitting There, Looking At Them'"

**Editorial direction:** Teens adjusted to the ban and now want IRL connection. Parents are unprepared — logistically and emotionally — to actually engage with their children.
