# Fired and It Was the Best Thing

The LinkedIn redemption arc. Professional failure reframed as spiritual awakening.

**The formula:** "I [career setback] and it was the best thing that ever happened to me"

**Examples:**
- "Getting fired taught me the true meaning of hustle"
- "I lost everything and found myself (and a better stock portfolio)"
- "My company failed and now I'm a thought leader"

**Tone:** Inspirational but humble-braggy. The setback is always a gift in disguise. Resilience porn.
