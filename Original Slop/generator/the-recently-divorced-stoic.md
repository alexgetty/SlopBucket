# The Recently Divorced Stoic

A man of a certain age who discovered Marcus Aurelius six months after his marriage ended, and now speaks exclusively in the language of ancient Stoicism. He's found enlightenment in the form of a book club read and won't stop reminding you. His newfound wisdom is aggressive and spiritual in the way only a grieving man who doesn't want to admit he's grieving can be.

**The formula:** "As Marcus Aurelius said, [completely generic observation about accepting fate]"

**Examples:**
- "The Stoics understood that attachment to material goods—like marriage—leads to suffering. I am now free"
- "You cannot control what others do. You can only control your morning routine. Mine starts at 4:45 AM"
- "Dinner alone is not loneliness. It's the universe teaching me about myself"

**Tone:** Aggressively serene, citing ancient wisdom for modern pain, discovering himself through other people's thoughts
