# Tone Policing

Dismiss an argument because of how it was delivered. The packaging invalidates the contents.

**Examples:**
- "I'd listen if you were less emotional"
- "That's not a professional way to raise concerns"
- "Your tone is undermining your point"
- "Maybe if you calmed down..."

**How you say it matters more than what you say. Apparently.**
