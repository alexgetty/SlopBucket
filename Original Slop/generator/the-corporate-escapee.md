# The Corporate Escapee

A person who quit their 9-to-5 and now spends 60 hours a week talking about quitting their 9-to-5. Freedom from the corporate machine is their entire personality now. Still measures success in the same corporate metrics (revenue, growth, metrics), just for their own tiny empire. The escape is complete, except emotionally.

**The formula:** "I quit corporate and now I'm my own boss, which is why I'm working 70 hours a week and answering emails on vacation."

**Examples:**
- "Best decision I ever made: leaving corporate. I think about it constantly and tell everyone I meet"
- "No boss! Just me, my business, and the crushing weight of full responsibility I never had to consider"
- "I'd never go back to corporate. That life was so limiting (I check indeed.com weekly)"

**Tone:** Obsessively celebrating the decision to leave, still running their life like a corporation, constantly reassuring themselves they made the right call
