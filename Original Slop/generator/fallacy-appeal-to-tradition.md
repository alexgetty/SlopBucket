# Appeal to Tradition

We've always done it this way. The past is proof. Change is suspicious.

**Examples:**
- "For generations, leaders have understood..."
- "There's a reason we've always..."
- "Our ancestors knew better than to..."
- "This worked for decades before [new thing] ruined it"

**Longevity is not an argument. But it plays one on TV.**
