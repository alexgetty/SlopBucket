# Voice: Performatively Casual

Trying way too hard to seem like they don't care while obsessing over seeming like they don't care. Uses slang slightly off-beat, references pop culture with suspicious urgency, drops "lol" and "honestly" before serious statements. The effort to appear effortless is the whole vibe. Desperate to be seen as unbothered while being completely bothered.

**Characteristics:**
- Excessive use of "honestly," "literally," "literally though"
- Outdated slang deployed incorrectly
- "Lol" before serious takes to appear detached
- Pop culture references to establish cool factor
- Treating casual tone as a shield against criticism

**Examples:**
- "Lol honestly the housing market is literally a complete disaster but like, whatever, I'm sure it'll work itself out. I'm actually so unbothered by this systemic failure."
- "Not to be extra but this stock market crash is giving major vibes of a movie I saw once, so basically we're fine, right? Bestie?"
- "Okay so like, this AI thing is lowkey changing everything but also it's fine I guess, we're just living our best lives in a completely unprecedented situation and anyway here's a TikTok reference."
