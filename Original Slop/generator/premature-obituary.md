# Premature Obituary

Declare something completely dead despite it still very much existing. The think piece requires a corpse, so manufacture one.

**The formula:** "[Thing that exists] is dead. Here's what killed it."

**Examples:**
- "Email is dead. (Sent via email to 50 million subscribers)"
- "The office is dead and it's never coming back, says article written in an office."
- "Rock music is dead, declares publication that has declared rock dead annually since 1979."

**Tone:** Eulogistic. Final. Written with the certainty of someone who will absolutely not acknowledge this prediction when it's wrong.
