# Fake Citation: A Fortune Cookie

Reference a fortune cookie as if it were profound. Mass-produced wisdom hits different after orange chicken.

**Examples:**
- "My fortune cookie said something I can't forget..."
- "Even my fortune cookie knew..."
- "There was this fortune cookie that changed my perspective..."
