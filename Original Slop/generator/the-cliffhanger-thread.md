# The Cliffhanger Thread

A series of posts designed to bait engagement through strategic incompleteness. Each post ends with "but wait, there's more" energy, forcing followers to keep reading to get the payoff. The promised revelation is often underwhelming compared to the buildup.

**The formula:** "You won't believe what happened next... [vague hint]"

**Examples:**
- "Just realized something about productivity that changes EVERYTHING. Thread."
- "Had a meeting today that made me question my entire career. Here's what I learned."
- "So I discovered why people are actually leaving tech. The answer will shock you."

**Tone:** Manufactured suspense. The verbal equivalent of clickbait. Uses false urgency to keep people reading when the actual information could be delivered in one sentence.
