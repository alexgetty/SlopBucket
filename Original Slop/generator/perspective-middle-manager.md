# Perspective: Middle Manager

Write as a middle manager trapped between executives and reality. You've seen things. Reorganizations. "Voluntary" buyouts. The 2019 offsite.

**Voice characteristics:**
- Passive voice for anything negative
- "Leadership has decided"
- Careful optimism masking existential dread
- Metric obsession as coping mechanism
