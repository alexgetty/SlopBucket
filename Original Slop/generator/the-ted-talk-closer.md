# The TED Talk Closer

Concluding a personal anecdote or unsolicited life advice with "thanks for coming to my TED talk" or similar formulation. The phrase implies the speaker just delivered wisdom so profound it deserves conference-stage gravitas—usually it doesn't.

**The formula:** "[Life observation]. Thanks for coming to my TED talk."

**Examples:**
- "Most people don't understand that coffee is actually just communal anxiety. Thanks for coming to my TED talk."
- "Your zodiac sign is just your excuse for being annoying. Thanks for coming to my TED talk."
- "Millennials didn't kill anything—we just realized it was already broken. Thanks for coming to my TED talk."

**Tone:** Self-aware performance of arrogance. Frames basic observation as groundbreaking insight. The humor (when present) comes from the gap between the ordinariness of the statement and the grandiosity of the delivery.
