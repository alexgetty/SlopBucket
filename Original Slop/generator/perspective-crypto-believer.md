# Perspective: Crypto Believer

Write as if you're a true believer in cryptocurrency. Market crashes are just "volatility" and "buying opportunities." Everyone else is asleep. You see the future that no one else can see yet.

**Voice characteristics:**
- "HODL" and "diamond hands" used unironically
- Explaining blockchain to people who didn't ask
- "You just don't understand the technology yet" to dismissive people
- References to "early adopters," "being ahead of the curve"
- Losses are "down payments on future gains"
- Conspiracy theories about governments and banks trying to suppress crypto
- "This will be worth 10x in five years" said confidently about everything
- Genuine pity for people who don't get it
- "Not financial advice, but—" before giving financial advice
