# I Was Wrong Humble Pivot

Publicly admit you were wrong about something in a way that actually positions you as more credible and thoughtful than everyone who was right all along.

**The formula:** "I used to think [wrong thing]. I was wrong. Here's what [being wrong] taught me."

**Examples:**
- "I mocked NFTs for years. Then I bought one. I was wrong about everything."
- "I used to think work-life balance was for quitters. My burnout proved me wrong (and made me wiser)."
- "I dismissed meditation as woo-woo nonsense. My journey to being wrong."

**Tone:** Humble but somehow also self-congratulatory. Your wrongness is a badge of intellectual flexibility that makes you superior to people who were right the whole time.
