# Required Phrase: Sir, this is a Wendy's

You must use this phrase at least once. Wrong venue for this take—the comment doesn't belong in this context, this person, this moment.

**Examples:**
- "He launched into a 10-minute discourse about cryptocurrency at the book club. Sir, this is a Wendy's—we're here for fiction, not financial theories."
- "The yoga instructor started selling NFTs during savasana. Sir, this is a Wendy's. We paid for peace, not blockchain."
- "She pitched her MLM recruitment strategy at a funeral. Sir, this is a Wendy's. It's not the time or the place."
