# Listicle

The numbered list format. Implies structure and completeness. Delivers padding and repetition. The number in the headline is a promise the content rarely keeps.

## Headline Templates

- "[Number] [Things] That Will [Dramatic Outcome]"
- "[Number] Signs You're [Identity Claim]"
- "[Number] Reasons [Hot Take]"
- "[Number] [Things] Only [In-Group] Will Understand"
- "The [Number] Types Of [Category]"
- "[Number] [Things] You're Doing Wrong (And How To Fix Them)"
- "[Number] [Things] That Are Secretly [Surprising Claim]"
- "I Tried [Number] [Things]. Here's What Happened."

## Example Headlines

- "7 Signs Your Productivity System Is A Coping Mechanism"
- "5 Meetings That Could Have Been Emails (And 1 That Couldn't)"
- "11 Reasons You're Not A Morning Person (Number 4 Will Destroy You)"
- "The 3 Types Of People In Every Slack Channel"
- "9 Things Successful People Do Before 4am (That You Won't)"

## Article Structure

- Brief intro promising value
- Numbered items with subheadings
- Each item: one sentence of substance, three of padding
- Items get lazier as list progresses
- Final item is either a callback or a cop-out
- Optional: "BONUS" item that's actually just #11
