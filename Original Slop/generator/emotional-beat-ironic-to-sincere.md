# Emotional Beat: Ironic to Sincere

Writer opens with heavy sarcasm and winking dismissal. Maintains the ironic tone through the middle section while gradually removing the air quotes. By the end, they're saying something genuinely sincere but it's too late—the tone has already made it absurd. The humor comes from the sincerity accidentally breaking through.

**Examples:**
- "Obviously we should all just quit our jobs and become influencers" → details the impossible economics → "I mean, sure, the system is rigged" → "but also everyone's trying their best within it" → "and maybe that's worth acknowledging" (reader realizes they actually meant some of that)
- "Sure, let's just destroy the planet for profit margins" → describes actual environmental destruction with sarcastic flourishes → "I'm joking but also those things are literally happening" → "and it's kind of terrifying actually" (tone shift reveals writer was always worried)
- "Dream jobs are for people with trust funds" → initially sardonic about privilege → "but also everyone deserves to work on something meaningful" → "like, ACTUALLY, we should probably structure society around that" (sincerity accidentally escapes through the sarcasm)
