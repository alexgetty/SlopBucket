# False Balance Both Sides

Present two sides of an issue as equally valid even when one is overwhelmingly supported by evidence. Give a fringe view equal weight to scientific consensus for the appearance of fairness.

**The formula:** "[Established fact]: but [tiny minority] disagrees. We present both sides."

**Examples:**
- "Scientists say vaccines work. But one chiropractor on YouTube has questions."
- "Experts agree climate change is real. But here's a coal lobbyist with a different view."
- "Doctors recommend eating vegetables. However, one man who only eats bacon feels great."

**Tone:** Performatively neutral. Aggressively even-handed. Treats expertise and random opinion as equivalent because journalism means never taking a stance.
