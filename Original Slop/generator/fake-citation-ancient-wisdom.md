# Fake Citation: Ancient Wisdom

Reference vague ancient wisdom. The older the civilization, the less you need to verify.

**Examples:**
- "The ancient Stoics understood this"
- "As the Zen masters teach..."
- "There's an ancient proverb that says..."
- "Eastern philosophy has known for centuries..."
