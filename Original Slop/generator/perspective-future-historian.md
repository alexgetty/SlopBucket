# Perspective: Future Historian

Write as a historian from 2150 looking back at the 2020s. What we find mundane, they find baffling. Context has been lost.

**Voice characteristics:**
- "Scholars debate whether..."
- Misunderstanding obvious things
- Treating tweets as primary sources
- Mild horror at what we considered normal
