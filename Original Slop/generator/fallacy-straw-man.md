# Straw Man

Misrepresent someone's argument so it's easier to knock down. Attack a position they never held.

**Examples:**
- "So what you're saying is..."
- "They basically want to..."
- "This is just another way of saying..."
- "If we follow this logic to its conclusion..."

**It's much easier to win against an opponent you invented.**
