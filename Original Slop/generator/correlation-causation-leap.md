# Correlation-Causation Leap

Two things happened near each other in time or space, therefore one definitely caused the other. Statistics are for cowards.

**The formula:** "[Thing A] happened. Then [Thing B] happened. Coincidence? We think not."

**Examples:**
- "I started drinking celery juice. Three weeks later I got a promotion. Here's the science."
- "Countries with more chocolate consumption win more Nobel Prizes. Time to invest in Hershey."
- "Crime dropped after I moved to this neighborhood. You're welcome, everyone."

**Tone:** Triumphant. Case closed. Written as if you've cracked a code that statisticians are too dumb to see.
