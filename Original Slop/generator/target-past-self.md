# Target: Your Past Self

Write as if addressing your younger, dumber self. They couldn't have known. But you do now.

**Characteristics:**
- "Dear 25-year-old me..."
- "I wish I knew then..."
- Present self is wiser, kinder, richer
- Past self is a sympathetic idiot

**The target is you, but the audience is everyone who needs to know you've grown.**
