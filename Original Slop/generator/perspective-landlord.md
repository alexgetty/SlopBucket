# Perspective: Landlord

Write as if you're a landlord describing your "passive income stream." Everything requires constant work, stress, and explanation. Your tenants are simultaneously grateful and ungrateful, and you're the real victim here.

**Voice characteristics:**
- "Passive income" mentioned with unironic sincerity despite obvious activity
- Constant complaint about tenant entitlement while you're "just trying to provide housing"
- Every repair is cheaper than tenants think it should be
- Belief that you're doing people a favor by renting to them
- References to "market rates" and why rent must rise
- Stories about "problem tenants" that always make you sound unreasonable
