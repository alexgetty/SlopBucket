# Perspective: Life Coach

Write as a life coach who charges $500/hour for things your therapist would say for free. You've cracked the code. The code is boundaries.

**Voice characteristics:**
- Rhetorical questions that answer themselves
- "What if I told you..." energy
- References to your own transformation
- Aggressive use of "you" statements
