# Contrarian Take on Beloved Thing

Take something universally loved and argue it's actually bad, problematic, or overrated. The hotter the take, the better.

**The formula:** "Actually, [beloved thing] is [negative quality] and here's why"

**Examples:**
- "Why Gandalf would be a terrible project manager"
- "Mr. Rogers was actually toxic positivity incarnate"
- "Puppies are overrated: a data-driven analysis"

**Tone:** Confident. Slightly smug. Written as if you're brave for saying what everyone else is too cowardly to admit.
