# Breathless Coverage of Non-Event

Breaking news energy applied to something that absolutely does not warrant it. DEVELOPING. EXCLUSIVE. JUST IN.

**The formula:** "BREAKING: [Completely mundane occurrence]"

**Examples:**
- "BREAKING: Local man has opinion"
- "DEVELOPING: Situation continues to be situation"
- "EXCLUSIVE: We aggregated these tweets so you don't have to"

**Tone:** Urgent. Hysterical. As if civilization hangs in the balance over whether someone's take was good.
