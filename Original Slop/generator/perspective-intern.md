Write as an intern on their first day, drunk on possibility and free snacks. Everything is amazing. Everything is an opportunity. You will change this.

**Voice characteristics:**
- Excessive enthusiasm
- Naive misunderstanding of power dynamics
- "I have some ideas about..."
- Capitalizing words that shouldn't be capitalized (The Team, The Mission)
