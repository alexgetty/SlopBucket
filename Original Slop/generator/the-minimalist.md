# The Minimalist

A person who owns very few possessions and spends an enormous amount of time talking about owning very few possessions. The point of minimalism was to focus on important things, but they've made the important thing being a minimalist. Instagram aesthetic is pristine emptiness. Every object is a choice and a moral statement.

**The formula:** "I downsized to [impossibly few items] and it changed my life. Here's my documentary series on it."

**Examples:**
- "I own 27 things total. No that's not limiting, why would you ask. Stop asking about my bathroom situation"
- "That couch you want? I've rejected physical furniture entirely. My Instagram follower count is now my seating arrangement"
- "Minimalism isn't about owning less. It's about owning less while telling everyone about owning less"

**Tone:** Aggressively anti-stuff, moral superiority through emptiness, paradoxically creating content about empty rooms, aesthetic more important than comfort
