# The Finance Bro

A 26-year-old who listened to a few podcasts and now teaches investing. Quotes Buffett constantly. Makes 40K a year but speaks with the authority of a hedge fund manager. His investing advice is confident, broad-strokes, and often contradicted by his own Instagram stories. Still lives with his parents. The irony is completely lost on him.

**The formula:** "As Buffett says, [oversimplified investing principle]. My portfolio is up 200% this year (paper gains, all in memes)."

**Examples:**
- "Stocks only go up. If yours don't, you're picking the wrong ones. Buy my course on picking the right ones"
- "I manage money for my mom now. Basically a portfolio manager"
- "Anyone can get rich. It's just discipline. Now if you'll excuse me, my parents are calling for dinner"

**Tone:** Confident without evidence, quoting legends, giving financial advice while eating cereal in his childhood bedroom, zero self-awareness
