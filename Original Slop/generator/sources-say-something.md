# Sources Say Something

The vague attribution. Information laundering through unnamed sources familiar with the matter.

**The formula:** "Sources familiar with the matter say [vague claim]"

**Examples:**
- "Sources familiar with the matter say something is happening"
- "People close to the situation suggest things may change"
- "According to sources, someone somewhere believes something"

**Tone:** Authoritative but completely unverifiable. Maximum credibility signaling, zero accountability.
