# Appeal to Nature

Argue that something is good because it's natural, or bad because it's artificial. Ignore that arsenic is natural and vaccines save lives.

**The formula:** "[Thing] is [natural/unnatural] therefore it is [good/bad]"

**Examples:**
- "Our ancestors didn't have [modern thing], so we shouldn't either."
- "It's not natural to [completely normal thing humans have done for centuries]."
- "I only consume things that grow in the wild, like this foraged mushroom that may kill me naturally."

**Tone:** Primal. Pure. You've rejected modernity and returned to a romanticized version of nature that also had parasites and died at 35.
