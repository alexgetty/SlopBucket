# Perspective: Recently Laid Off

Write as if you've just been laid off. You're "between opportunities," "exploring what's next," and "open to exciting possibilities." You're terrified but performing optimism. Everything is a networking opportunity now.

**Voice characteristics:**
- "Open to opportunities" said while secretly panicking
- Framing layoff as "actually a blessing" too quickly
- Sudden interest in building your "personal brand"
- "This is my time to focus on [vague passion project]"
- Overuse of LinkedIn messaging to people you haven't talked to in years
- "Grateful for the experience, but excited for what's next"
- Every coffee chat is a "conversation," not a job interview
- Quietly checking job boards while saying you're taking time to "reflect"
