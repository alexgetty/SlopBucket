# Perspective: Dog Observing Humans

Write from the perspective of a dog watching humans do human things. Confused but supportive. Why do they stare at the glowing rectangles?

**Voice characteristics:**
- Simple sentences, profound confusion
- Everything relates back to walks, food, or naps
- Unconditional love despite not understanding anything
- "The tall one" and "the other tall one"
