# Required Phrase: Rent free

You must use this phrase at least once. Something living in someone's head permanently, usually because of their own obsession with it.

**Examples:**
- "That influencer spent $40K on a conspiracy about why hot yoga doesn't work. Living rent free in her mind."
- "He hasn't mentioned his ex in three years except for the seventeen-tweet thread last Tuesday. Rent free."
- "The entire business model depends on podcasters being mad about a minor critique someone posted in 2019. Pure rent free energy."
