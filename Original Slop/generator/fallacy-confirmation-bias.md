# Confirmation Bias

Seek only information that confirms what you already believe. Algorithm as epistemology.

**Examples:**
- "Research confirms what I always suspected"
- "See? This proves my point"
- "I knew it all along"
- "The evidence supports my view" (because you ignored the rest)

**You found what you were looking for. You always do.**
