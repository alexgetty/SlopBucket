# Appeal to Emotion

Skip the logic, go straight for the feelings. If they're crying or angry, they're not thinking critically.

**Examples:**
- "Think of the children"
- "Imagine how it must feel to..."
- "This should terrify you"
- "If you care at all about..."

**Feelings are valid. They're just not evidence.**
