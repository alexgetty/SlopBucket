# Listicle That Could Be One Sentence

Expand a single thought into a numbered list with artificial padding. Each item restates the core idea with slightly different words.

**The formula:** "[Number] [Things] That [Outcome]" where all items are the same thing

**Examples:**
- "7 Ways to Drink More Water: 1) Drink water 2) Have water nearby 3) Remember to drink water 4) Set water reminders..."
- "10 Tips for Being On Time: 1) Leave earlier 2) Don't leave late 3) Depart with more time 4) Begin commute sooner..."
- "5 Secrets to Better Sleep: 1) Sleep more 2) Go to bed 3) Be asleep 4) Rest horizontally 5) Close eyes in bed"

**Tone:** Helpful but hollow. You've turned one idea into content by adding numbers and line breaks.
