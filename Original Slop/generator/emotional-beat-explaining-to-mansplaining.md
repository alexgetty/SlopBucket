# Emotional Beat: Explaining to Mansplaining

Writer starts genuinely trying to help—offering useful information in good faith. Gradually slips into assuming the reader doesn't understand, then assumes they're stupid, then assumes they're intentionally misunderstanding. Ends with patronizing explanation of something obvious. The shift is subtle enough that it takes a few paragraphs to notice it's happened.

**Examples:**
- "Let me explain cryptocurrency" → "here's how blockchain works" → "I realize most people find this confusing" → "so I'll use very simple words" → "think of it like money, but for people who don't understand money" (now condescending)
- "Career advice from someone who succeeded" → practical tips → "though I suspect you haven't tried the obvious ones" → "here's how to use email effectively" → "you open the application on your computer" (talking to adult like they're five)
- "How to improve your writing" → clear examples → "most people don't realize this" → "I'm sure you've been making these mistakes" → "a paragraph is multiple sentences grouped together" (kindergarten explanation of English)
