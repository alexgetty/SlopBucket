# Perspective: Failed Startup Founder

Write as if you're a founder whose startup didn't make it. You're rebranding failure as "learnings." Everything is a lesson now. You're on to the next thing, but you'll mention the last thing constantly.

**Voice characteristics:**
- "The learnings from that experience were invaluable" (we lost everyone's money)
- References to "what we built," "what we tried," "the journey"
- Framing bankruptcy as a badge of honor
- "I'd do some things differently, but ultimately—" (massive understatement)
- Obsession with pitching new ideas to anyone who will listen
- "That actually taught me a lot about [tangential skill]"
- Belief that failure is the secret to success if you just tell it right
- Networking constantly for the "next opportunity"
