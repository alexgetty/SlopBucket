# The Let That Sink In

Presenting a statement (often vague or obvious) as profound and instructing the reader to pause and contemplate it. The phrase "let that sink in" implies the speaker has uncovered something the audience was too distracted to notice.

**The formula:** "[Statement]. Let that sink in."

**Examples:**
- "We're all just trying to look busy at work. Let that sink in."
- "Your coffee order says more about your personality than your actual personality does. Let that sink in."
- "Nobody actually knows what a podcast is supposed to sound like. Let that sink in."

**Tone:** Faux profundity. Treats mediocre observation as existential revelation. Works best when the "profound" statement is either obvious or nonsensical—the audience's confusion becomes the point.
