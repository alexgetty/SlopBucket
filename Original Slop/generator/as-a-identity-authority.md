# As-A Identity Authority

Invoke an identity category to grant yourself authority on a topic that may or may not be related. The "as a" creates rhetorical immunity.

**The formula:** "As a [identity], I can tell you [opinion now shielded by identity]"

**Examples:**
- "As a mother, I can tell you this tax policy is wrong."
- "As someone who once visited France, the French are exactly like this."
- "As a former child, I'm an expert on childhood development."

**Tone:** Authoritative by association. Your identity is your credential, regardless of actual expertise.
