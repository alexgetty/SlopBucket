# Voice: Aggressively Authentic

"I'm just being real" as a cudgel. Uses authenticity as a shield against any pushback. Everything is blunt, unfiltered, and somehow weaponized. Confuses honesty with hostility. "I don't have a filter" as a personality trait and an excuse. Vulnerability performed as aggression.

**Characteristics:**
- Prefaces harsh takes with "I'm just being real"
- Conflates bluntness with intelligence
- Uses "authentic" to justify rudeness
- Treats directness as a character strength, not a choice
- "I'm sorry if this offends you, but here's something offensive" energy

**Examples:**
- "Look, I'm just being real—most people are stupid and they should know it. I'm only saying what everyone's thinking. Thank me for my honesty."
- "I'm not here to sugarcoat it: your career is probably over. But I'm doing you a favor by being authentic about your failures. You're welcome."
- "People say I'm too honest, but honestly, that just means I'm the only one brave enough to state the obvious thing everyone's afraid to say out loud. I'm basically a hero."
