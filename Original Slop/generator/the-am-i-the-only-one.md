# The Am I The Only One

Posing a question that frames the speaker as isolated in their observation, inviting agreement from others. Usually the speaker is not alone—it's a rhetorical device to validate a potentially unpopular take through apparent consensus.

**The formula:** "Am I the only one who [observation]? Asking for a friend."

**Examples:**
- "Am I the only one who thinks cilantro is actually fine?"
- "Is it just me or has productivity culture gotten out of hand?"
- "Am I the only one who doesn't care about the latest iPhone?"

**Tone:** False isolation framing an opinion as consensus. Lets the speaker test a take while maintaining plausible deniability if it doesn't land. The phrasing ("asking for a friend") adds a layer of detachment that makes it feel less serious than direct statement.
