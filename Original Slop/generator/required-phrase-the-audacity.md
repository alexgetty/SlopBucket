# Required Phrase: The audacity

You must use this phrase at least once. Outrage at someone's boldness, often performative and out of proportion to the actual transgression.

**Examples:**
- "He showed up to the meeting without reading the notes. The audacity. The unpreparedness. The sheer confidence."
- "She charged $1,200 for a workshop about 'finding your purpose' and then didn't show up. The audacity was astronomical."
- "They released a product update that no one asked for and acted surprised when people complained. The audacity to not care."
