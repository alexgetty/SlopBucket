# Anecdote as Trend

One person did a thing, therefore it's a sweeping generational or cultural shift. Sample size of one is statistically significant when it confirms your thesis.

**The formula:** "[Single person] is [doing thing]. Is this the future of [entire category]?"

**Examples:**
- "I met one 25-year-old who doesn't use Instagram. Gen Z is abandoning social media."
- "My neighbor started gardening. The Great Return to the Land has begun."
- "A barista told me she's tired. Millennials are rejecting the hustle economy."

**Tone:** Breathless trend-spotter. You've got your finger on the pulse and that pulse is one random person you talked to at a coffee shop.
