# Format: Rhetorical Question Required

Must include at least one rhetorical question. Make the reader think you're making them think.

**Examples:**
- "But what if there was another way?"
- "Sound familiar?"
- "What are we really optimizing for?"
- "Have you ever stopped to wonder why?"

**The answer is always implied. You're not actually asking.**
