# The Ratio Bait

A post intentionally designed to provoke disagreement and engagement. The poster throws out a take they know will draw corrective or angry replies, boosting algorithmic performance through conflict.

**The formula:** "[Deliberately provocative statement]."

**Examples:**
- "Coffee is worse for you than energy drinks."
- "Expensive sneakers are the worst investment ever."
- "Productivity apps are why you're burned out."

**Tone:** Designed friction. Positions contrarianism as insight. The poster doesn't need to be right—they need engagement. The "ratio" (when replies outnumber likes, meaning disagreement) is actually the goal.
