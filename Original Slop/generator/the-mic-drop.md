# The Mic Drop

A statement designed to end all discussion on a topic. Usually phrased as a definitive pronouncement, sometimes followed by silence or an exit. The speaker positions themselves as having delivered the final word.

**The formula:** "[Definitive statement about subjective thing]. And that's final."

**Examples:**
- "Pineapple on pizza is fine, people who make a big deal about it are weird. That's it."
- "If you don't like your job, that's a you problem. Period."
- "Cereal is a salad. I'm not explaining further."

**Tone:** Conversational slam dunk. Uses false certainty and refusal to elaborate as a substitute for actual argument. The confidence suggests wisdom but often masks just being stubborn.
