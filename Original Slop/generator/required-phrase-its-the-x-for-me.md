# Required Phrase: It's the [X] for me

You must use this phrase at least once. Specific callout of the one detail that breaks the whole thing, delivered with finality.

**Examples:**
- "The founder seemed cool until he used 'synergy' twice in the same sentence. It's the casual misuse of corporate speak for me."
- "The course looked interesting until they misspelled 'guarantee' in the sales page. It's the lack of QA for me."
- "The influencer's whole brand is about minimalism and then she flexes five luxury purchases in one Stories session. It's the hypocrisy for me."
