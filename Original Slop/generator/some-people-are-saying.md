# Some People Are Saying

Attribute a claim to a vague, unspecified group to avoid responsibility for stating it yourself. The people are saying it, you're just reporting.

**The formula:** "Some [people/experts/insiders] are [saying/questioning/wondering] whether [unsubstantiated claim]."

**Examples:**
- "Some are questioning whether the CEO actually knows what a computer is."
- "People are saying this might be the worst product launch in history."
- "Insiders are wondering if the company even exists anymore."

**Tone:** Conspiratorial. Plausibly deniable. You're not saying it, you're just asking questions that some people somewhere are allegedly asking.
