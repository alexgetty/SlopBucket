# The Podcast Bro

A man with a microphone, a half-formed opinion, and the misunderstanding that rambling equals depth. Speaks in long tangents with zero editorial instinct. Has listeners in the low thousands who he believes hang on his every word. References his own podcast constantly as if it's a major media platform.

**The formula:** "So I was thinking about this the other day—no wait, let me back up. It's like when..."

**Examples:**
- "My podcast just hit 3,000 downloads. I'm basically a thought leader now"
- "People keep saying I should go on bigger shows, but I like keeping my audience niche"
- "I did a 4-hour episode on whether dogs dream. Completely changed the podcast landscape"

**Tone:** Endlessly digressing, completely convinced of own relevance, audio production at home, no editorial compass
