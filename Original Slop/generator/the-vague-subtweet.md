# The Vague Subtweet

Complaining about someone, something, or some situation without naming them directly. This allows the poster to vent while maintaining plausible deniability and keeping their audience guessing about the target.

**The formula:** "Can't believe some people [vague behavior]. You know who you are."

**Examples:**
- "If you're the type of person who does X, we can't be friends."
- "Really disappointed when people show their true colors like that."
- "Wow. Just wow. No words. Well, I have words but I'm taking the high road."

**Tone:** Passive-aggressive with a veneer of maturity. Creates drama through ambiguity while the poster gets to feel they're being the bigger person by not naming names.
