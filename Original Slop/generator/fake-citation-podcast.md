# Fake Citation: A Podcast You Half-Remember

Reference something you heard on a podcast. Details fuzzy. Confidence absolute.

**Examples:**
- "I was listening to a podcast and they said..."
- "There's this great podcast episode about..."
- "I think it was Tim Ferriss? Or maybe Brene Brown? Anyway..."
