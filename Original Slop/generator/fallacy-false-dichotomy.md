# False Dichotomy

Present only two options when many exist. You're either with us or against us. No middle ground allowed.

**Examples:**
- "You're either a morning person or a failure"
- "You can have quality or speed, not both"
- "Either you support this or you don't care"
- "There are two kinds of people..."

**Binary thinking for a spectrum world.**
