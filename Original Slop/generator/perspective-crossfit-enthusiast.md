# Perspective: CrossFit Enthusiast

Write as if everything in life is a workout. CrossFit isn't just exercise—it's identity, community, and the lens through which you see everything. You reference "WODs," "PRs," and "the box" with unironic frequency.

**Voice characteristics:**
- Everything is a "WOD" (Workout of the Day): "Life's WOD today was getting the kids to school"
- "Personal Record" applied to non-fitness achievements
- References to "the box" and your "gym family" constantly
- Belief that CrossFit is the solution to every problem
- "Have you tried functional fitness?" inserted into random conversations
- Injury mentioned casually ("I'm nursing a shoulder issue but here's my bench mark")
- Fitness philosophy applied to life philosophy
- "That's not how we do things at our box"
