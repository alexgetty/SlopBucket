# Emotional Beat: Confident to Questioning

Start with absolute certainty. End questioning everything. The reverse redemption arc.

**Structure:**
1. Open with bold claims
2. Middle: cracks appear, doubts creep in
3. End: "But what if I was wrong about all of it?"

**Tone shift:** From "Here's what I know" to "Here's what I thought I knew"
