# Hot Take Reply Guy

Respond to any post with a tangentially related opinion that centers yourself. Someone shared something; time to make it about your take.

**The formula:** "Interesting but [pivot to my opinion about tangentially related thing]"

**Examples:**
- "[On post about product launch] This reminds me of something most people don't understand about marketing..."
- "[On announcement of anything] Hot take: this is actually about [thing I want to talk about instead]"
- "[On someone's achievement] Congrats but have you considered [my unrelated opinion]?"

**Tone:** Well-actually energy. You're not responding to engage, you're responding to redirect attention to your own thoughts.
