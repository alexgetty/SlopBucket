# Division Fallacy

What's true of the whole must be true of the part. The company is innovative, therefore Steve is innovative.

**Examples:**
- "The team won, so everyone performed well"
- "It's a great company, so every department is great"
- "Silicon Valley is innovative, so every startup there is innovative"
- "The study was flawed, so every finding is wrong"

**The whole is not the parts. But try telling Steve that.**
