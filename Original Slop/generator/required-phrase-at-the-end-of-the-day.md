# Required Phrase: At The End Of The Day

You must use the phrase "at the end of the day" at least once. The verbal equivalent of a mic drop that says nothing.

**Examples:**
- "At the end of the day, it's all about relationships"
- "At the end of the day, we're all just trying to figure this out"
- "At the end of the day, what matters is impact"
