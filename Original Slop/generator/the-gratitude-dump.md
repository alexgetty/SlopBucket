# The Gratitude Dump

Public expression of thankfulness for people, opportunities, or circumstances. Often performed for an audience rather than communicated privately, mixing genuine appreciation with social performance and virtue signaling.

**The formula:** "So grateful for [people/things]. Here's why they matter."

**Examples:**
- "Grateful for my team, my family, my dog, and the strength to keep going."
- "I don't say it enough: thank you to everyone who believed in me."
- "Blessed to have [achievement]. Couldn't have done it without [group]."

**Tone:** Performative vulnerability. Mixes actual gratitude with audience performance. The public declaration serves multiple purposes: genuine thanks, reputation management, and performance of humility. Works when sincere, becomes obvious when it's not.
