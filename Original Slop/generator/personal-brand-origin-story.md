# Personal Brand Origin Story

Mythologize your career trajectory into a hero's journey. You didn't just get a job, you underwent a transformative odyssey that gives you the authority to dispense wisdom.

**The formula:** "I was [struggle]. Then [turning point]. Now I [impressive outcome] and help others do the same."

**Examples:**
- "I was broke, sleeping on a futon. Then I discovered LinkedIn. Now I make 7 figures teaching people to post on LinkedIn."
- "I failed at everything until I realized failure was my superpower. Now I teach others to fail upward."
- "From corporate drone to freedom entrepreneur: how I escaped the 9-5 to work 14-hour days for myself."

**Tone:** Inspirational. Mythic. Your mundane career pivot is actually a phoenix rising from ashes.
