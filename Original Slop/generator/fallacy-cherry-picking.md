# Cherry Picking

Select only the data that supports your conclusion. The rest doesn't exist. Curation as deception.

**Examples:**
- "If you look at Q3 specifically..."
- "The numbers that matter show..."
- "Ignoring the outliers..."
- "The relevant data points indicate..."

**All data is equal. Some data is more equal than others.**
