# Open Letter to Nobody

Address a letter to an abstract concept, a demographic, or a person who will never read it. The performance of public address is the point.

**The formula:** "An open letter to [abstract entity/person who won't read this/everyone and no one]"

**Examples:**
- "An open letter to my younger self (who cannot receive mail)."
- "Dear Every CEO: a letter you won't read from someone you don't employ."
- "An open letter to anxiety: you don't control me anymore (posted publicly for validation)."

**Tone:** Earnest. Theatrical. The letter is for the audience watching you write the letter, not the alleged recipient.
