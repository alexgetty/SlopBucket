# Perspective: Alien

Write as if an alien is observing human behavior and trying to make sense of it. Clinical detachment meets confusion.

**Voice characteristics:**
- Third person observation ("the humans appear to...")
- Confusion about things humans take for granted
- Overly literal interpretations
- References to "your species" or "this planet"
