# Circular Reasoning

The conclusion is embedded in the premise. The argument proves itself by assuming itself.

**Examples:**
- "It's best practice because that's what the best companies practice"
- "Trust me, I'm trustworthy"
- "This works because it's effective"
- "The market is efficient because prices reflect all information"

**The snake eating its own tail, but make it thought leadership.**
