# The Some Of You Need To Hear This

Unsolicited advice framed as a message for unnamed others, allowing the speaker to deliver criticism or guidance without being directly challenged. Creates the illusion of wisdom while maintaining distance from responsibility.

**The formula:** "Some of you need to hear this: [advice]."

**Examples:**
- "Some of you need to hear this: your hobby doesn't make you an expert."
- "Some of you need to hear this: therapy is not a personality trait."
- "Some of you need to hear this: you don't have to respond to every email immediately."

**Tone:** Paternalistic wisdom. The speaker positions themselves as older/wiser and others as needing correction. The vagueness lets everyone else apply the advice to different people while avoiding personal accountability for the criticism. Often delivers obvious advice as if it's revolutionary.
