# False Cause (Post Hoc)

A happened before B, therefore A caused B. Sequence as causation. Correlation as destiny.

**Examples:**
- "I started journaling and then got promoted"
- "Ever since they changed the logo, sales dropped"
- "I switched to standing desks and my anxiety disappeared"
- "Mercury was in retrograde, which explains everything"

**After this, therefore because of this. Classic.**
