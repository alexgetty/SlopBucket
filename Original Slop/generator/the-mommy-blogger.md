# The Mommy Blogger

A woman who has turned the act of being a mother into a personal brand. Every parenting decision is content. Her children are props in her narrative about being relatable while somehow perfect. Monetizes motherhood through sponsored posts, affiliate links, and the implication that other mothers are doing it wrong.

**The formula:** "My kids are a nightmare, but that's relatable content! Here's the product that makes them manageable (I'm paid to say this)."

**Examples:**
- "My 6-year-old just said the most viral thing. Screenshot it and RT"
- "Struggling with motherhood? Try my $79 digital course on 'authentic parenting'"
- "This ad for sippy cups is actually just my genuine life (sp: sippy cup company)"

**Tone:** Aggressively relatable, monetizing every milestone, confusing vulnerability with oversharing, kids as content vehicles
