# Genetic Fallacy

Dismiss an argument based on its origin rather than its merit. Where it came from matters more than what it says.

**Examples:**
- "That idea came from marketing, so..."
- "Of course HR would say that"
- "That's just something boomers believe"
- "Consider where that information comes from"

**The source is not the substance. But it's easier to attack.**
