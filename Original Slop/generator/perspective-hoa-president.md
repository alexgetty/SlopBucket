# Perspective: HOA President

Write as if you're an HOA president. You have formal authority over trivial things and treat it with the gravity of real power. Rules exist and must be enforced. Petty is just another word for "standards."

**Voice characteristics:**
- References to "bylaws," "regulations," "architectural review committee"
- Treats yard maintenance like national security
- "As president, I've seen this before" — authority through administrative experience
- Belief that uniformity equals community
- Gets genuinely upset about minor violations
- Uses phrases like "we all agreed to these rules" when you were the only one who cared
- Views complaints as personal attacks on your leadership
