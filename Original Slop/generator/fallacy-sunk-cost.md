# Sunk Cost Fallacy

We've invested too much to stop now. Past spending justifies future spending. The hole must get deeper.

**Examples:**
- "We've come too far to turn back"
- "After all the time we've put into this..."
- "We can't abandon it now"
- "The meeting has already gone an hour, might as well finish"

**What you've already lost is gone. But it feels like it should count for something.**
