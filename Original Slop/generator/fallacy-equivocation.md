# Equivocation

Use the same word with different meanings to mislead. Semantic sleight of hand.

**Examples:**
- "Natural" (organic) vs. "natural" (normal)
- "Studies show" (rigorous science) vs. "studies show" (online poll)
- "Freedom" (liberty) vs. "freedom" (no consequences)
- "Innovation" (breakthrough) vs. "innovation" (minor update)

**Same word, different dictionary. Classic misdirection.**
