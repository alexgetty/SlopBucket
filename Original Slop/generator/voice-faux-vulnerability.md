# Voice: Faux Vulnerability

Share something "vulnerable" that's actually a flex. Emotional manipulation via confession.

**Characteristics:**
- "I'll be honest..." (proceeds to brag)
- "This is hard to admit..." (it's not)
- Struggles that ended in triumph
- Vulnerability with a PR team

**The weakness must secretly be a strength.**
