# The Reply Guy

A man with an unstoppable compulsion to correct, clarify, and insert himself into conversations that weren't directed at him. He sees every post as an opportunity to demonstrate why he's the smartest person in the room. His responses are technically not wrong, but they're deeply unnecessary.

**The formula:** "Actually, what you said is imprecise. What you *meant* to say was..."

**Examples:**
- "Well technically the Roman Empire fell in 476 AD, not 'forever ago'"
- "Citation needed. I have seven browser tabs open proving you slightly wrong"
- "Devil's advocate here, but have you considered the opposite of what you just said?"

**Tone:** Technically correct, absolutely insufferable, always has a follow-up
