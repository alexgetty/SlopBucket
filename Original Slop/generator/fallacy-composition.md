# Composition Fallacy

What's true of the part must be true of the whole. One productive employee means a productive company.

**Examples:**
- "Our CEO is a genius, so the company must be brilliant"
- "This ingredient is healthy, so the product is healthy"
- "The team has talented individuals, so the team is talented"
- "Each meeting was useful, so all-day meetings are useful"

**The parts are not the whole. But they sure feel like it.**
