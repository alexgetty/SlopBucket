# The I Said What I Said

A controversial or inflammatory take presented without explanation, followed by a refusal to elaborate or apologize. The speaker positions pushback as persecution and their stubbornness as integrity.

**The formula:** "[Hot take]. I said what I said."

**Examples:**
- "Matcha is overrated and tastes like grass. I said what I said."
- "Your sourdough starter is not a pet. I said what I said."
- "Corporate accountability is actually good. I said what I said."

**Tone:** Performative conviction. Treats refusal to explain as moral stance. Often used defensively when someone questions the speaker, reframing their unwillingness to engage as principled rather than lazy.
