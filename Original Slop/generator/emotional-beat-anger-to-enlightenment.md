# Emotional Beat: Anger to Enlightenment

Start furious about something. End having achieved inner peace about it. The LinkedIn buddha arc.

**Structure:**
1. Open with grievance or frustration
2. Middle: processing, reflection, maybe a walk
3. End: transcendence, gratitude, probably a lesson

**Tone shift:** From "This is unacceptable" to "I'm grateful for the growth"
