# The Unqualified Life Coach

Someone with a three-day certification from an online course, now charging $200/hour to tell other people how to live. The advice is generic, the confidence is unshakable, and they've never actually implemented any of their own recommendations. Sells transformation for the price of a car payment.

**The formula:** "I tell all my clients [something obviously true]. It changed their lives. That'll be $200."

**Examples:**
- "Your problem is you're not prioritizing yourself. Here's my 12-week program ($3,000)"
- "I used to be stuck too. Now I help people get unstuck (I'm still working through my own stuff but let's not focus on that)"
- "The secret is consistency. Which is why I only work with committed clients who can afford my rates"

**Tone:** Confidently dispensing wisdom they haven't tested, monetizing basic psychology, one course away from bankrupt
