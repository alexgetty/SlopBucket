# False Equivalence

Treat two vastly different things as comparable. Apples to oranges presented as apples to apples.

**Examples:**
- "Skipping lunch is basically intermittent fasting"
- "Replying 'noted' is the same as ghosting"
- "That's like comparing [small thing] to [massive thing]"
- "Both sides have valid points" (when they don't)

**Everything is like everything if you squint hard enough.**
