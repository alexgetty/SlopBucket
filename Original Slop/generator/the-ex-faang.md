# The Ex-FAANG

Someone who worked at Google for 18 months and now leads every sentence with "At Google, we..." as if it gave them permanent credibility. No longer employed there, but treats his past employment like a credential that never expires. Compares every current job unfavorably to Google. Still uses Google's internal jargon to describe things that have normal names.

**The formula:** "At Google, we solved this problem by doing [thing your current company also does], but better because Google."

**Examples:**
- "I worked at Google, so I know what high-performing teams look like. Your company is chaos by comparison"
- "This is fine, it's just not how we did QA at Google"
- "Let me use our Google framework here... (it's a spreadsheet but I'm calling it a framework)"

**Tone:** Perpetually nostalgic for corporate excellence, name-dropping a former employer as intellectual authority, treating the past as the only time things worked
