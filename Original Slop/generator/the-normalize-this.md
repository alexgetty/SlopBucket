# The Normalize This

Suggesting that some thing, behavior, or idea should be socially accepted or destigmatized. Often applied to things that don't actually need normalizing—either already normal or actively harmful.

**The formula:** "Normalize [thing]. It's not weird."

**Examples:**
- "Normalize eating lunch alone. You don't need company to enjoy food."
- "Normalize therapy. Your trauma doesn't make you special."
- "Normalize asking for the Wi-Fi password at someone's house."

**Tone:** Social advocacy framed as basic common sense. Usually well-intentioned but sometimes applied to trivial things (as if they weren't already normal) or things that probably shouldn't be normalized. The format assumes the audience is judging when they might not be.
