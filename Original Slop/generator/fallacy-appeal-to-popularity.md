# Appeal to Popularity

Everyone's doing it, so it must be right. Consensus as proof. The bandwagon has no brakes.

**Examples:**
- "73% of LinkedIn users agree..."
- "Millions of people can't be wrong"
- "This is why everyone is switching to..."
- "The market has spoken"

**Popularity is not validity. But it sure feels like it.**
