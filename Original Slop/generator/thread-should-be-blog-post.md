# Thread That Should Be a Blog Post

Break a cohesive thought into artificial fragments for engagement. Each tweet adds suspense to information that doesn't require suspense.

**The formula:** "THREAD: [Topic]. [Number] things I learned. A story. 1/ [cliffhanger into next tweet]"

**Examples:**
- "I just realized something about success. It changed everything. A thread. 1/"
- "THREAD: In 2019 I made a mistake. It taught me 15 lessons. Here they are. (1/47)"
- "Stop scrolling. This might be the most important thread you read today. 1/"

**Tone:** Breathless. Serialized. Every thought ends with implicit "wait for it" energy even when the payoff is obvious.
