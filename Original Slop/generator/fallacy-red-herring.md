# Red Herring

Introduce an irrelevant topic to derail the conversation. Suddenly we're talking about something else entirely.

**Examples:**
- "The real issue here is..."
- "What people should be asking is..."
- "This reminds me of a completely different situation..."
- "But have you considered [unrelated thing]?"

**If you can't win the argument, change the subject.**
