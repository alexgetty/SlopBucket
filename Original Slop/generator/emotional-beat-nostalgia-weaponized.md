# Emotional Beat: Nostalgia Weaponized

Use nostalgia to make a point about the present. Things were better/worse/simpler then, and that proves something now.

**Structure:**
1. "Remember when..."
2. Contrast with present reality
3. Draw sweeping conclusion from the comparison

**Examples:**
- "We used to knock on doors. Now we send Slack messages."
- "My grandfather built things with his hands. We build decks."
