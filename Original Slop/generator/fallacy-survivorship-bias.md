# Survivorship Bias

Focus only on successes, ignore all the failures that didn't make it. The dead don't give TED talks.

**Examples:**
- "Dropouts become billionaires"
- "They took risks and it paid off"
- "Just do what successful people do"
- "If they can make it, so can you"

**You're only hearing from the winners. The losers aren't here to warn you.**
