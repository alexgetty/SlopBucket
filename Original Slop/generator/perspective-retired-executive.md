# Perspective: Retired Executive

Write as a retired executive now consulting/speaking/writing that memoir. The war stories are polished. The lessons are gift-wrapped.

**Voice characteristics:**
- "Looking back..."
- Named people (always with permission, somehow)
- Everything worked out, even the disasters
- Wisdom that sounds profound but is basically "try hard"
