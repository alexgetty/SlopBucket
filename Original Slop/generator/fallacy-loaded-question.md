# Loaded Question

Ask a question that presumes guilt or contains a built-in assumption. Any answer accepts the premise.

**Examples:**
- "Have you stopped ignoring your team's Slack messages?"
- "Why do you hate innovation?"
- "When did you give up on your dreams?"
- "Are you still making that mistake?"

**The question is the accusation. The answer is irrelevant.**
