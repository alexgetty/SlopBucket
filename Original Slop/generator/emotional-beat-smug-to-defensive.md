# Emotional Beat: Smug to Defensive

Writer opens with unshakeable confidence and superior knowledge, then gradually encounters pushback or complications that force increasingly desperate justifications. Ends scrambling to defend position that seemed airtight at the start.

**Examples:**
- "I've figured out why everyone else is doing productivity wrong" → gradually reveals contradictions in their own system → "but that doesn't mean MY approach is flawed, you're just not implementing it correctly"
- "Crypto bros who explain blockchain technology with total certainty" → hit with a basic technical question → "well actually, you need to understand the UNDERLYING philosophy to appreciate it, which most people don't"
- "Wellness influencer explaining how they cured their health issues through willpower alone" → asked about edge cases → "those people probably weren't COMMITTED enough, or they had other factors like genetics" (conveniently unfalsifiable)
