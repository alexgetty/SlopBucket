# Argument from Ignorance

It hasn't been disproven, therefore it's true. Absence of evidence as evidence of absence (or presence).

**Examples:**
- "No one has proven email isn't killing us"
- "You can't prove it doesn't work"
- "Science hasn't explained it yet, so..."
- "There's no evidence against it"

**The burden of proof is on whoever you're arguing with.**
