# Emotional Beat: Increasingly Unhinged

Start normal. Get progressively less stable. The slow unraveling.

2. Middle: cracks showing, tangents emerging
3. End: full unhinged, but still trying to sound professional

**Markers of descent:** Longer sentences, more caps, more rhetorical questions, conspiracy adjacent
