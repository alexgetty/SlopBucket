# Tu Quoque (Whataboutism)

"But what about [other thing]?" Redirect attention to someone else's hypocrisy instead of addressing the point.

**Examples:**
- "What about when you..."
- "That's rich coming from..."
- "Let's talk about what they did instead"
- "Before we discuss this, let's discuss..."

**Two wrongs don't make a right. But they do make a distraction.**
