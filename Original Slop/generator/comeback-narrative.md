# Comeback Narrative

The thing you declared dead six months ago is back. Treat its continued existence as a triumphant resurrection rather than evidence your obituary was premature.

**The formula:** "The surprising return of [thing that never left]. Why [thing] is making a comeback."

**Examples:**
- "Vinyl is back! (It never stopped being sold in every record store)"
- "The shocking return of reading books. Why Gen Z is rediscovering literature."
- "Email makes a surprising comeback as the future of communication."

**Tone:** Amazed. Delighted. Written as if you didn't personally declare this thing dead, or as if declaring and undeclaring death is just how trends work.
