# I Did Weird Thing, Here's What Happened

Personal experiment journalism. The writer does something unusual and reports back with life-changing insights.

**The formula:** "I [unusual action] for [time period]. Here's what happened."

**Examples:**
- "I let my Uber driver run my company for a week. Here's what happened."
- "I only spoke in corporate buzzwords for a month. The results shocked me."
- "I deleted Slack and my productivity increased by 4000%"

**Tone:** Personal, anecdotal, completely unscientific but presented as universally applicable truth.
