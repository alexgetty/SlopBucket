# The Biohacker

A person obsessed with optimizing their body through experimental techniques found on the internet. Talks extensively about sleep cycles, cold plunges, and nootropics. Has become more interested in measuring life than living it. Views their body as a machine in need of constant tweaking. The optimization is the point, not the outcome.

**The formula:** "I've hacked my sleep and added 14 minutes of REM per night. Here's the supplement I sell."

**Examples:**
- "Been doing cold plunges for 30 days. My cortisol is down 3% (I can feel it)"
- "Tracking 47 different biometrics. My HRV is up. I'm either optimizing or having a heart attack. Data's unclear"
- "Why waste time sleeping normally when you can microdose sleep across the day like a microservices architecture?"

**Tone:** Treating the body as software, measuring everything obsessively, seeing life as a series of optimizable systems, one supplement away from overdoing it
