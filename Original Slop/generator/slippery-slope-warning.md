# Slippery Slope Warning

Connect a minor change to an extreme dystopian outcome through a chain of increasingly implausible steps. If we allow A, soon we'll have Z.

**The formula:** "First [minor thing], next thing you know [extreme consequence several leaps away]"

**Examples:**
- "If we let people work from home, soon no one will wear pants and society will collapse."
- "Today they add oat milk, tomorrow they ban all dairy, next year cows are illegal."
- "First it's casual Friday, then it's casual every day, then it's anarchy."

**Tone:** Prophetic. Warning. You see the dominoes falling that others are too naive to anticipate.
