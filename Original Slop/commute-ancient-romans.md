# 5 Signs Your Commute Was Actually The Best Part Of Your Day (Ancient Romans Knew This)

*I spent three years championing remote work. I was wrong—and I'm brave enough to admit it.*

Like many of you, I celebrated when my commute disappeared in 2020. No more traffic. No more forty-five minutes of staring at brake lights while questioning every career decision I'd ever made.

I was a fool.

It took me three years of working from my kitchen table to realize what the ancient Sumerians understood intuitively: **suffering in transit is the foundation of human meaning.**

## 1. You Had Mandatory Decompression Time

The Stoics called it *transitio obligatus*—the forced passage. Your commute gave you something no meditation app can replicate: time you couldn't optimize. You couldn't answer emails while merging onto the highway.

Now you roll from bed to desk in eleven seconds and wonder why you feel behind.

## 2. Your Podcast Queue Had Purpose

I have 847 downloaded episodes I will never listen to. They sit in my app like a content graveyard.

[[Dr. Jennifer Holloway]], a behavioral economist I follow on OnlyFans, recently posted that the average remote worker has accumulated 340 hours of "aspirational audio content" since 2020. "We keep downloading," she wrote, "because we remember when we had time that was only ours."

## 3. You Had a Reason to Leave

Your commute was a boundary. A socially acceptable reason to say "I have to go now."

The Mayans had a saying: "The man who is always present is never truly there."

Now the meeting that should end at 5:00 bleeds into 5:47 because what are you going to do, commute to your living room?

## 4. Your Curated Feed Looked Better By Comparison

Nothing made your own life seem tolerable like scrolling Instagram while stuck in traffic. Sure, [[Bethany]] was in Santorini again, but you were eating gas station snacks in your car, alone, accountable to no one.

That contrast is gone. Everyone's highlight reel is filmed in the same room now.

## 5. You Were Accidentally Present

My commute was the only time I wasn't performing. Not for my boss. Not for my family. Not for the algorithm.

The Babylonians called this *shalamu*—the peace of passage. Scholars believe it's why they invented the wheel.

Some suffering has purpose. Some transitions matter.

The ancients knew this. I just had to sit in my kitchen for three years to figure it out.
