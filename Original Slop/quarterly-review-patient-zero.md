# Experts Warn: First Case Of Employee Enjoying Quarterly Review Detected In Colorado

A single employee in the greater Denver metropolitan area reportedly "didn't mind" his Q4 performance review last Tuesday, and experts are sounding the alarm.

[[Greg Forsythe]], 34, a mid-level operations analyst at a logistics company he asked us not to name, described the 45-minute meeting with his manager as "fine, actually." The admission has sent shockwaves through the HR community, which is now racing to understand how this happened and whether it can be contained.

"We're seeing isolated cases like this emerge," said one expert who studies workplace sentiment. "One becomes two. Two becomes a cluster. We need to take this seriously before it spreads."

According to data we compiled specifically for this article, employee sentiment toward quarterly reviews breaks down as follows:

- **71.2%** — Appropriate dread (baseline, healthy)
- **19.4%** — Apathy; "forgot until calendar reminder" (concerning)
- **6.7%** — Mild discomfort only (elevated risk)
- **2.7%** — Prepared talking points in advance (critical)

"That last group is what keeps us up at night," the expert added.

Contact tracing has proven difficult. [[Greg]]'s manager, who also reported the meeting was "productive," is now under observation. Three colleagues who passed [[Greg]] in the hallway afterward said he "seemed normal," but authorities aren't ruling out asymptomatic transmission.

"I prepared talking points," [[Greg]] explained, seemingly unaware he was describing early-stage symptoms. "My manager also prepared talking points. We discussed them. I got a 'meets expectations.' I went back to my desk."

He then added, unprompted: "I think people overcomplicate these."

Experts urge employees to monitor themselves for warning signs: reduced dread, manageable expectations, or any sense that the process "wasn't that bad." If symptoms appear, isolate immediately and do not discuss your experience with coworkers.

To those who said this could never happen: [[Greg]] is patient zero.

Q1 reviews begin in April. Experts recommend avoiding preparation, maintaining low expectations, and keeping all meetings under fifteen minutes. There is currently no vaccine.
