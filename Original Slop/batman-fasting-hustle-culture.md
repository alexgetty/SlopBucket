# Analysis: What Batman's Fasting Routine Tells Us About Hustle Culture

*By [[Jordan Chen]], Strategy Intern (Day 1)*

Batman doesn't eat breakfast. I learned this during onboarding today—not from HR, but from a YouTube video I watched in the bathroom while pretending to read the employee handbook. And honestly? It explains everything.

Think about it. Bruce Wayne runs a Fortune 500 company, maintains peak physical condition, and fights crime every night until 4am. You don't do that on three meals a day. You do that on a 20:4 eating window and the kind of discipline that comes from watching your parents get murdered in an alley.

I know what you're thinking: "[[Jordan Chen|Jordan]], you've been here for six hours. Maybe focus on learning where the printer is." But that's exactly the kind of limiting mindset that keeps people from seeing the bigger picture. And I'm here to see the bigger picture.

## What This Really Means

Batman's fasting protocol isn't just about autophagy or metabolic flexibility—it's a statement about modern productivity culture. When you're not eating, you're not stopping. You're not taking a "lunch break" like some kind of person who believes in work-life balance. You're compressing your nutritional intake into a focused window so you can allocate more cognitive resources to punching the Joker.

This is, frankly, what I plan to bring to my internship.

My manager, [[Steve]], told me today that my first project would be "helping organize some files." But when I look at that task through the Batman framework, I see something more. Those files aren't just files. They're Gotham. And Gotham needs someone willing to skip breakfast.

## The Data Is Clear (Probably)

I don't have access to the company's analytics dashboards yet—[[Steve]] said I'd get login credentials "sometime this week"—but I imagine if I did, the data would support my thesis. The highest performers in any organization are almost certainly the ones who've replaced their morning oatmeal with black coffee and a sense of purpose.

Consider: Batman has never been photographed eating a sandwich during a meeting. Coincidence? I've been here six hours and I already see patterns that others miss.

## Critics Will Say

Some people—probably people who eat lunch—will argue that Batman is a fictional character and that basing workplace philosophy on his dietary habits is "concerning" and "not what we asked you to do with those files." To them I say: every great idea seemed crazy at first.

Also, I should note that Batman has unlimited resources and a butler who definitely handles his meal prep, whereas I have a mini-fridge and a roommate who keeps eating my yogurt. But I think that actually strengthens my point. If even billionaires with personal chefs choose to compress their eating windows, what excuse do the rest of us have?

## What To Watch For

Going forward, I'll be monitoring several key indicators:
- My own productivity levels (I expect a 340% increase)
- [[Steve]]'s reaction when I pitch this as a company-wide initiative
- Whether the free snacks in the kitchen are actually a test of willpower

I'm only six hours into this internship, but I already feel like I understand something fundamental about success that my colleagues have been too distracted—by food, mostly—to notice.

Batman saw a problem and became the solution. I see a file organization task and I see an opportunity to become the Batman of file organization. Fasted. Focused. Ready.

I'll report back tomorrow. Assuming I don't pass out at my desk.
