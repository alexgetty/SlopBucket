## Distribution Tiers

### Tier 1 - Direct Pitch (content is native)

Content can be posted directly; tone and subject matter align perfectly.

- **r/LinkedInLunatics** — Thought leadership pieces are built for this
- **r/antiwork** — Quarterly review, meetings, corporate culture content
- **r/FitnessCirclejerk** — Cold plunge, wellness grifter content

### Tier 2 - Adaptation Needed

Requires framing or positioning work.

- **r/nottheonion** — Only allows links to "real" news. Need to position Slop Bucket as satire-that-reads-real (tricky, may not accept)
- **r/thathappened** — Could work if articles framed as "found in the wild"

### Tier 3 - Meta Play

Requires articles to circulate first; secondary amplification.

- **r/AteTheOnion** — Post screenshots of people believing Slop Bucket articles

- Avoid purely meme-focused communities unless content is heavily formatted for that
